Yo! If you ever get beaten up by monsters you can just eat some food to instantly heal yourself! \nDid you know that?
"I have eaten food before, you little brat. \nI know how food works!"
"Well did you know that some food is SO DELICIOUS that it completely STUFFS you, and you can\'t eat any more food for a while?! \nStuff like hamburgers and pizza are just too good!"
"Oh, that\'s a new mechanic I think...      \n\nI guess I\'ll stick to fruit for now."
"Greetings, youngster! I see you know some unique skills! \nYou can spam most of those as much as you want, with no cost at all! But some skills have a cooldown time, which means you can\'t use them again for a few turns..."
"Cooldowns, huh? We\'ve got a few skills like that. \nAre cooldowns just there to balance the extremely powerful stuff?"
"Yeah, for example, I can only cast \""Giga-Doomsday\"" once every 10 turns! \nNot that I would ever use such a spell anyway. I\'m a friendly wizard, of course. \nIt\'s just a coincidence that the southern continent was obliterated recently."
"Heya! I\'m Tandalf and this is my partner, Randalf. \nWe\'ve been together for 13 years now, studying magic across the world. \nThere\'s a lot to learn out there, and I\'m sure you\'ll learn plenty of cool skills as you spend your AP in the \""Skills\"" menu!"
"Don\'t try to sneak tutorials into casual conversations! \nI\'m going to beat the game without learning any skills, just to spite you."
"Haha, don\'t blame me if that doesn\'t work out."
Someone gone stole my socks and glasses. \nWhat year is it again?
"Oh, my things! \nThat\'s precious!"
I feel a lot better now.
"Hehehe, I feel like I\'m only 80 years old again. \nEven my memory is coming back! \nThanks, son!"
I\'m not your son though.
"You there, traveller! \nYou emerged from the depths of the jungle did you not? \nWould you happen per chance to have some spare lumber? \nI\'d like to rebuild these totems that were destroyed by the shaking land."
"Thank you, traveller! \nMay your kindness carry you far in this world."
I shall begin work right away.
"Ahhh, I\'ve restored them to their former beauty.                   \n\nI can finally relax."
"I was excavating an underground chasm here, but this huge monolith fell from the sky and blocked off the entrance to my tunnel! \nI\'ll need some explosives to move this thing out of the way..."
"Aha, perfect! That\'s just the stuff I needed! \nCome back in a few minutes and you\'ll be able to see what\'s underneath this thing..."
Give me a moment to work here!
"Here\'s what I was working on before that monolith came crashing down. \nThis puzzle has got me stumped...               \nIf you can solve it, the treasure\'s all yours."
H-hey! Whatcha lookin\' at me like that for? \nI ain\'t no thief! \nThere\'s no hidden door back here! \nGet outta \'ere! Scram before ya get hurt!
(What a nice fellow...     \nI hope that\'s not how people see me.)
"I\'m worried about my grandfather. \nHe doesn\'t believe in modern medicine, and so he doesn\'t take any coffee with him while hunting... \n\nHe won\'t be able to revive his fallen allies without coffee!"
"Unless you\'ve got a powerful healer in your party, carrying some garlic is also very important. \nYou never know when you could be poisoned, stunned, or worse!"
I don\'t really like garlic though... and I don\'t think my cat likes it either.
Nya nya!
"Well, I have one more little tip for you. \nIf you\'re unfamiliar with status effects, you can see a list of them in the \""Stats\"" and \""Equips\"" menus. \nJust hover over them in to see their names!"
"I can hit these targets no problem, but fast enemies still give me some trouble. \nI guess it\'s hard to hit enemies that are at a higher level than me, and well... I\'m level zero."
Also... flying enemies! \nThey tend to dodge attacks quite well.       \n\nSniping skills come in handy sometimes.
"We\'ll keep an eye out on our accuracy stat! \nAs I understand it, if your accuracy is higher than a foe\'s evade, you can\'t miss!          \n\nWell, with the exception of a very few skills that have extra low accuracy."
"I attempted to hunt that lumbering beast up ahead, but it thoroughly thrashed me. \nMaybe my granddaughter was right... I should have brought more coffee with me."
That reminds me - now would be a good time to look through our available skills and make sure we have the right ones powered up.
"At least I\'ve got a Slime Bunny in this bucket! \nThat\'s saved my life a couple of times for sure. \nOh, and one more thing: I\'m certain that bosses will never stop summoning backup. \nThey\'ve got an endless supply of mooks to replace fallen ones."
I may have to start listening to her advice. \nShe\'s way more knowledgable about healing items than I am.
"Indy is obsessed with his tunnel, but I think this monolith is way more interesting! \nI wonder where it came from, and are there more like it? \nWhy is it glowing? Is there some hidden meaning behind these markings? \nI have so many questions!"
"At any rate, there\'s sure no shortage of mysteries in this world. \nAt least we\'ve got our \""Info\"" menu to help keep track of different quests and collectibles."
"Oh yeah, I kinda forget that all of those info menus down there exist. \nMaybe I should check those every once a while and have a look at my progress."
"Have you tried capturing any monsters yet? \nIt gets tricky with the stronger ones. \nLowering their HP is not enough, you gotta lower their stats too, and status effects like stun and freeze help the most."
"But most strong enemies are resistant to status effects... right? \nI suppose I could check their resistance info by scanning them, but sometimes I forget to do that."
Every little effect helps. \nWith stronger monsters you\'ll be able to stack quite a lot of effects before it keels over.
I\'m just passing through. There \'aint much to stay for around here... \nMaybe I\'ll just whack a few enemies before moving onto the next area.
"I agree. \nI\'m just warming up, but once I\'m stronger I\'ll be heading overseas for greater challenges."
"Did you know some enemies respawn if you leave the area? \nIt\'s only the ones that aren\'t blocking any major paths though. \nYou can use them to farm resources if you\'re stuck, though you usually shouldn\'t need to."
"Yep, this is my 16th espresso today! \nEyeballs starting to pop out a little bit! \nBut I\'m feeling good, man!"
I\'ve never really been a fan of coffee. \nMaybe that will change someday...
"So many shiny and weird items! \nI don\'t even know what these are for, but they\'ve gotta be useful for something, right? \nMaybe some items are just looking for the perfect home, someone to bring happiness to, you know?"
I like items because I\'m greedy and obsessed with collecting things. \nSome say it\'s not an attractive character trait.
"This foul cyclops has appeared out of nowhere and blocked off the entrance to my cave! \nIf you\'re going to fight it you should be warned: You\'ll need a lot of stamina. \nMake sure you\'re prepared, and if that\'s still not enough, you can run away from the battle and try out some different armor too."
"Matt and NoLegs, you should really listen to this guy. \nBeing gung-ho about everything isn\'t always the way to go. \nSometimes you need to step back and think about your strategy!"
"Pfft, I\'ll never back down from a foe! \nI\'ll never run away!"
"There\'s no shame in running away to fight another day, in fact there\'s no penalty at all. \nThat\'s how most of us are still alive today."
"Hey you, you shouldn\'t be back here. \nTalk to the table in front of me if you want to buy something."
"Sorry, I totally wandered back here by accident! \n(I\'m not eyeballing your chest or anything.)"
"Steroids are good for you, they truly are. \nThey buff up your stats permanently, so it\'s a great idea to eat as many as you can find. \nThe only drawback is that you may die young with an empty wallet... but you didn\'t hear that from me."
"Argh, these prices are a scam! \nI\'m better off finding these items in treasure chests or cutting them out of monsters! \nBut sometimes there\'s that one last item I need to upgrade a weapon... so I guess I just have to put up with the prices or waste hours looking for a certain item..."
"When times get desperate I come here with uncle Ross to sell our leftover items. \nThey don\'t give us a good deal, but sometimes we just really need the money quick, you know what I mean? \nIf you can afford it, you\'re better off just hoarding your items until you need them someday. \nWe\'ve got unlimited inventories after all."
"Ack, I\'ve been working like a dog all day. \nThe earthquake\'s thrown up big balls of dirt all over the place, and many roads are blocked off. \nI think there\'s a shovel at the market, but a big pile of dirt is blocking the way there too! \nGotta take the longer roads to get anywhere today..."
"Oh, you\'ve found the shovel? Good for you. \nWhere were you earlier when I needed you, mate? \nI\'ve already finished my shift, my work here is done. \nOh fine... you can have some coffee too."
"Hey Matt, did you feel that earthquake too? \nI dunno what\'s going on, but I wouldn\'t be sitting at home if I were you. \nStuff\'s going down, man."
"Yeah, I\'m heading out to check things out and stretch my legs. \nCan\'t play video games with my electricity out. Gotta get that fixed."
"Man, you\'re LUCKY to even have electricity around here at all! \nAlso on the way over here I saw a weird cat going through your trash. \nMight need to keep an eye out for that thing."
Cats are alright.              \n\n(It\'ll make a fine dinner...)
"Hey Matt, stuff is REALLY going down! This old bridge is out! \nThe only way across the water now is by raft, and ironically, the raft maker lives on the other side of the water! \nSo we ain\'t getting no rafts, man!"
"Everything\'s gonna be fine. \nWe know how to get across, we just gonna go through the Ice Cave!"
We? Who\'s the girl? And the cat? \nAre you ditching me again? \nWhy can\'t we ever hang out?
"Well uh, I... maybe some other time."
"Dammit, Matt! What the hell? \nYou\'re travelling around with all these new friends?          \n\nYou think you\'re some hotshot now that you don\'t have me weighing you down, eh?"
Now\'s not the time for thi-
"Whatever, man. \nI\'m gonna go look at internet memes for the rest of the week.         \n\nYou\'re dead to me."
"Wow, he\'s mad.              \n\nYou better not abandon us, Matt... or else."
"Welcome to die, asshat!"
"What the hell? Is that you, Jeff?           \nHave you got a case of the \'tism?"
Jeff is gone. He\'s made some new friends and become one of the nameless ones. \nHis life was actually quite meaningless until now.
(Is this somehow my fault? Have I been... a bad friend?)
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..............................
"Hey Jeff - I know! - We can play some Euro Duck Simulator tomorrow if you want!? \n(The world might be destroyed by then, so I have a convenient way out...)"
"Really?! I\'m up for that! \nSounds good to me!           \n\nIf I\'m not executed for deserting, I\'ll definitely be there!"
"Oh hey, Matt. \nYou look like you\'ve just wandered outside for the first time in weeks. \nI suppose you\'ve forgotten how the outside world works?"
"Pfft, don\'t patronise me. \nI can look after myself."
"Well, in case you\'ve forgotten, buckets of water contain slime bunnies which will heal you up quickly! \nAnd that over there... that is a shop. You can go through the door-"
Shut up! \nI can explore on my own!
"Huh? Oh, it\'s you..."
"What the hell are you doing in my house, Chad?!"
"Finders keepers - it\'s my house now! \nYou\'ve not been home in days, and some of us can make better use of this property - which your parents actually stole from my family in the first place!"
"Hey now, you can\'t blame me for the sins of my ancestors. \nI\'m busy now, but someday I\'ll be back to kick you out!"
We got \'quakes and beasts and burglars. \nNothin\' but problems around \'ere. \nI\'d move to Greenwood right now if I could afford it. \nI\'d even leave the husband behind if I had to.
"I got sent in here to hunt, but I\'m not tough enough to handle it. \nEach time I poke a monster, I get my head ripped off soon after. \nThe only reason I\'m still around is because of Autosave - which kicks in every time I move to a different screen. \nI think winning battles also triggers Autosave, but I wouldn\'t know anything about that..."
Well we can\'t all be heroes. \nSome people just need to stand around hopelessly to make the rest of us look good!
"Heya! I\'m on a mission to collect ancient earthenware made by the different tribes on this island. \nIf you see any weird figures, bring \'em back to me. They\'re usually just lying around in the open.         \n\nThe dog? Oh, she\'s useless. Too pudgy to even walk."
"Oh, you found them all? And you\'re giving them to me? \nThanks a bunch!"
I\'ve got quite the collection of old stuff now! \nWhen I\'m done studying I may need to donate it all to Raymond\'s museum.
"I got hurt bad by monsters. A dog would protect me, but I can\'t afford one. \nI\'m starting to consider asking some sketchy fellows to find me one. \nI won\'t even ask where it came from, honest! I just really need a friend!"
"Oh, this is the dog you found for me? \nHe... doesn\'t look very fierce. I\'ll try to train him I guess."
It\'s not going well so far. \nHe won\'t even rip things to shreds on command yet...
Me and Interceptor are best friends now! \nHe eats any strangers that try to harm me!
WHAT THE HELL?!?! \nWhy did you do that?!
"Errr, I just wanted to see what would happen...           \n\nI didn\'t think it would-"
I HOPE YOU ALL DIE!!!               \n\nYou bunch of dog killers! \nYou burst my puppy like a balloon!
(Are we... actually the bad guys?)
H-hey! You can\'t be back here! \nGet in front of the counter like everyone else!            \nYou\'re not an inspector are you? \n(I\'m not hiding anything...)
We\'re stranded here for now. \nFirst time we\'ve had a chance to eat in ages... and yet I\'d rather be starving. \nThe food downstairs isn\'t fit for human consumption. \nAt this point I\'d even eat a squid or a kid.
Aff with ye! I\'m waitin\' for news aboot ma son! \nHe used to be craftin\' rafts by the water. \nIf ya ever see the fellow let me know if he\'s still kickin\'. \nI\'ll have some drinks for \'im til then. *glug*
Ma son\'s fine? Thank ye so much... *sob* \nYer a good matey! Have some brew on me!
"Heya! \nYou look broke, get outta here! \nWe don\'t serve bums!"
Rude! \nI dress this way by choice!
"Oh my, a wealthy gentleman appears! \nPlease have a seat! I\'ll bring a-"
"Pfft, get outta here. \nI just came back to parade my money now that you can\'t treat me like trash anymore!"
"Oh Matt, buddy! You\'ve returned home! \nI\'m sure you\'ve got lots of cool stories to tell, but I\'ve got an emergency! \nMy basement is too messy and I can\'t find my fishing rod and sunglasses in there! \nThis sounds like a job just for you! No one else can be trusted with this!"
"Cheers, Matt. You\'re the best. \nGlad my wife ain\'t alive to see the mess down there!"
Now to find a good spot...
*Hic!* I\'m having a great time! \nTurns out drinking beer is more fun than fishing. \nAll I could catch was octopus anyway!
(Why do I put up with this guy\'s chores? \nHe doesn\'t even have any valuables to pay me with...)
Get out of my way!         \n\nTalk to the table in front of me if you wanna order something.
"I once stood upon the great wall and shot down dozens of marching beasts. \nI\'m a hero among my people, and yet I earned no achievements because I did not do this on \""Epic\"" mode. \nReal life is just a game to those guards in that mansion. \nHumanity is doomed at this rate."
Aloha! This is master Raymond\'s mansion and contains his collections of worldly treasures and noble artwork. \nIt\'s not open to the general public - only a very select elite are allowed to enter.
"Oh, so you\'re trashing on me cause I\'m poor, yeah? \n(Just wait, I\'ll steal a small fortune in no time...)"
"Achievement medals are our currency of virtue here. \nCollect a lot of medals and we shall recognise you as a cultured and classy individual. Only then will entry to the collections be granted to you. The minimum entry requirement is 10 medals, but each room in the mansion has an even higher requirement."
"This is the master\'s room, the most esteemed room in the building. \nOnly those which have mastered every aspect of learning and academic achievement may enter here. \nThat means collecting every medal there is, and that\'s no small task!"
That sounds like a hell of a grind. \nIs it even worth the effort?
"I\'ve been in there, and it\'s not that special. \nBut we gotta save something for the most devoted gamers, don\'t we?"
"Sorry, I\'m just a rookie... talk to my dad here if you want to know the rules."
"Yo, I\'m afraid I can\'t let ya\'ll just waltz in here, mate. \nI\'m gonna need to see at least 25 medals before you can go inside. \nI take my job very seriously don\'tcha know?"
"Darn, you\'ve already accomplished more on your adventure than I ever will in my entire life. \nThings are looking kinda bleak for me, mate."
"My righteous drill-spear has never failed to penetrate my target. \nI have been tasked to hold this ground and not let any lowlifes or troublemakers through. \nFrom looking at you I can sense that you don\'t even have 45 medals, and thus cannot be trusted."
You guys are alright. I\'m starting to sense an aura of respectability from you. \nYou\'re young but you\'ve already made a bit of a mark on the world. That\'s kind of cool.
I am Leonidas son of Leonidas son of Leonidas son of Leonidas etc.... and I shall stand here firmly until a worthy hero wielding at least 15 medals shall honour me with their presence and dismiss me.
"You bring honour to your ancestors, young heroes, much unlike the dishonour I bring to mine. \nI am merely a human wall."
Show me the 35 medal and I let you through. \nOtherwise you no can go through.        \n\nPlease bad English.
"You very interesting people, I can tell. \nSometimes good, sometimes not so good. \nBut still very powerful, and with much of heart."
Grandpa and grandma say that this whole mansion will be mine some day!               \n\nI hope they die soon!
"(Woah, what a brat!)"
"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. \nWhat did you do? What did you say to grandpa?! \nWhy is he mad at me? He can\'t give you all the stuff, it\'s MINE! \nI hope weasels EAT YOUR FACE!!!"
"Suck it, you snotty brat! \nThat\'s what you get for being disrespectful!"
"Ray used to travel the world collecting items of interest from every town he visited. \nThese days he\'s a bit fragile and mostly stays home, tending to the guests. \nBut his collection continues to grow, as more and more patrons continue to send in artwork to be displayed in these rooms. \nIt warms my heart."
"Hey, I\'m Ray, the owner and curator of this here museum of treasures! \nI\'m sure I\'ll see a lot of you in the days to come, as you look like someone with a keen eye for treasure and art. \nI hope you enjoy your time here. This is my life\'s work on display."
"Cool story, old bro."
"Hey, you\'ve made it! This is it, my private room. \nYou\'ve earned a little tour of it - in fact, I\'ve got a little secret prize for you!"
"Eh, a prize?        \n\nWhat\'s that then?"
"This whole mansion will be yours one day, Natalie!             \nI\'ve decided to write you into my will."
"Umm, what?! \nR-really?!"
Why her and not me?!
"Oh wow! \nCongratz, Natz! \nThis could be the start of that career you\'ve always wanted!"
Is this a coup? \nHave you been conspiring behind my back? \n(Or am I just overthinking this and being paranoid?)
"Natalie\'s a regular visitor, and I trust her to look after the place more than anyone else. \nIn fact she\'s contributed quite a lot of historical research over the years. \nShe\'s more qualified than anyone.             \nThe rest of you, I only trust to... well... not steal from your teammate."
I\'m really honoured!             \n\nI\'ll do my best if you really decide to go through with this!
"It\'s already been settled. \nAll of this will be yours - but I may bury a few bars of gold with myself for the afterlife, hehehe. \nJust in case."
"Congratulations, comrade. \nI will honour this agreement, and keep my jealousy to myself."
"Wow, definitely congratulations. \nThis is for the best - none of us besides Natalie would know how to manage a huge place like this."
"This is amazing news, Natalie, we\'ll finally have a place to hoard all of our treasure! \nI won\'t have to carry tons of stuff with me anymore!"
"Y-yeah, I guess so! \nThis could be exactly what we need to help us on our future adventures. \nYou\'re all welcome here, I wouldn\'t dream of taking this all for myself."
"Well, I guess that settles it. \nWe\'ve officially finished everything there is to do in Epic Battle Fantasy 5!             \nCongratulations to us! (And to the player too!)"
Meow!
There\'s some fascinating art on these walls. It seems to tell the story of- \nHey! It looks like you!
There\'s so many paintings of us! \nThis is a lot to take in so quickly! \nI never thought I would have fans!
"I think I look pretty cool! \nNot as good as in real life, of course, but close enough!"
"Why do I look so angry and evil in all of these paintings? \nI think these artists have an agenda - this is character assassination! \n(Well, maybe I\'ve earned it - to a degree.)"
I hope I don\'t see any more drawings of me in awkward situations... \nBut these look very cute.
"Yyyyyymmmmmmnnnggghhhh....      \nI\'m eating chilli peppers to stay warm, but I dunno if it\'s working. \nI feel warm for sure, but I also feel like I\'m dying."
"Hey, how about sharing some of those with us?"
"Nah, I\'m good.           \n\nChillies are super rare, and I save them for emergencies like this one."
"Yeah, we live in this cave, what of it? \nWe\'re only letting you through because you killed that cyclops. \nOtherwise this is our home and you best respect that."
I\'ll make sure my allies behave. \nTheir hands sometimes go places where they shouldn\'t.
Pffft! You can\'t tell me what to do! \nAnd NoLegs doesn\'t have hands!
"Nya, nya, nya!"
"Oh, sorry, NoLegs.\nI wasn\'t making a joke at your expense."
Nya!
Cave is best house. No one ever try to steal. \nWell... except monster. Monster can go die from fire in hell. \nI eat his bone for dinner!
"I agree - monsters are tasty! \nExcept for slimes though, those make me sick."
"Eh, did you just come through that cave? \nWhat\'s your business here at the Iron Fortress? \nOur leader, Lance, will easily destroy you!"
Them\'s fighting words! \nI\'ve heard about what you guys are up to!  \nI aint afraid of no NPCs!
Heheheh... \nLance is no mere NPC... you\'ll see.
Officer Helmut of the heavy artillery division reporting for duty! \nOperation Hellfire has begun! \nWe\'ve been ordered to flatten all forests to make way for our army!
Could you please reconsider? \nA lot of rural people will lose their homes.
Orders are orders. \nI am not programmed to disobey.
Our glorious leader has promised us the western continent once we\'ve conquered the world. \nI hope you don\'t have friends or family there!
"Hey, that\'s my home, and you can\'t have it! \nI\'d like to see you scrubs occupy more than the tiles you\'re standing on!"
Our leader is cunning. \nHis robot army will definitely prevail.
Why are you breaking into our fortress?! \n This is an act of war!
Ya\'ll started it! \nI won\'t forgive you until we\'ve cleared out this whole place and smashed that huge hover-car!
I have faith in our cause! \nThe Iron Fortress will never fall!          \n\nYou don\'t stand a chance against Lance!
"I\'m just here for the pay... which isn\'t even very good... but these other guys really believe they can take over the world. \nI don\'t think that\'s going to happen, but I don\'t want to bring it up either."
"Psst, get out while you still can! \nThese guys are scumbags!           \n\nGreenwood Village will pardon your crimes if you surrender."
Intruders!      \n\nWhy is our security so bad?! \nHow are you getting past all of the traps?!
"It looks like your hardest puzzles are all optional. \nThis castle isn\'t secure at all! \nThat\'s good news for me, especially, since I can\'t do puzzles at all."
"So you guys beat Lance, huh? Perhaps I underestimated you. \nI\'m not gonna mess with you anymore... I wouldn\'t stand a chance.             \n\nI admit it, you win, and I surrender."
"Next time you\'re ordered to kidnap women and burn down the countryside, perhaps you should consider if what you\'re doing is in any way ethical."
"Yes, ma\'am. \nMistakes have been made."
Well I sure chose an awful group to get involved with. All of this destruction could have been avoided if we weren\'t so greedy and shortsighted. I\'ll see if there\'s anywhere where I can help out with the restoration efforts. \n\nPlease... forgive me.
"I\'m sorry that I dragged you into this, comrade. \nThe blame is mine to bear - and I will move forward and restore our honour."
"Why did you do this to us?! \nAll I wanted was to rule my own country, as is my birth right! \nAnd you took that away from me! How even dare you?!"
I\'m not going to lose sleep over this.
"Some people never learn their lesson, huh? \nGuess I\'ll put this guy on the village blacklist."
"Look at what these damned fascists have done! \nI\'ve explored these woods since I was young, and they\'ve destroyed them! \nBut I\'m not gonna take this lying down... I\'m planting seeds to help restore the vegetation.                     \nWould you like to help me?"
That\'s awesome! \nThis will help me out a lot! \n               \nThis really means a lot to me!
Together we\'ll restore these woods! \n              \nI won\'t rest until it\'s done... but I\'m really tired already.
"The bridge is out. That is very not good. \nI can make it more good, and fix it. I\'ll need... some sticks. \nThere should be a bunch just lying around in this area."
Very good. This is all that I need. \nI\'ll have this bridge rebuilt in no time.
Everything is going to be good!
"Hey you there, did you know that fascists are bad? \nDid you know that MURDER IS BAD?!"
"Uh, um... it might have crossed my mind at some point.     \n(I\'ve killed a lot of animals though, is that wrong too?)"
"Well you can help fight fascism by MAKING A LOT OF NOISE on social media. \nWe\'re trying to get trending on Twatter, to let the whole world know that fascism is bad! \nWe won\'t stand for that kind of stuff!"
"They say it\'s the thought that counts, but in this situation I think only action is going to get my friend back."
FASCIST SCUM!
"Wh-who, me?!"
FASCIIIIST SCUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
(She\'s in some sort of trance... and quite scary. Maybe I should leave her alone.)
"Are you releasing me? Am I really free to go? \nThanks, man! You\'re truly righteous, that you are!"
"Yeah I guess so. \nI saw treasure in this cell, and that\'s what got my attention. \n\nBut I guess fixing human suffering is alright too."
"I\'ll let you know something I noticed earlier... there\'s some switches around here that lower the spike walls in the main hall. \nI saw the officers putting them up. \n            \nThe mechanism seems quite simple though, so I\'m sure you\'ll figure it out!"
Are there more jail cells like this? \nAre there more prisoners?
"Yeah, tons of them, man. \nI saw them packing a bunch of young girls into a huge cell near the main hall."
Natalie must be there! \nWe need to unlock all the hallways and cells!
"Matt! It\'s you! \nDon\'t tell me you\'ve joined this cult of military freaks!? \nWe\'ve been neighbours for years, but you\'ve always been locked inside your hut. Is this what you\'ve been planning?!"
"Naw man, I\'m releasing you! I\'m gonna defeat these clowns. \nThey went too far when they kidnapped... a person I know."
"That\'s good to hear, I\'m glad you care about me! I\'ll be heading home then. \nMaybe I\'ll go fishing or something. \n\nYou should pay me a visit once this is all over."
"Oh, a friendly human face has appeared. \nI was beginning to think of this room as my home. \nI guess the outside world still exists, but I\'m not in a hurry to return. \nI\'ve actually got a bed with sheets here, so that\'s an improvement over my previous home."
"Don\'t let life get you down, gramps! \nWork hard and you\'ll go places!"
"That\'s easy for a player-character to say. We NPCs are shackled to a pathetic way of life. \nThe most cruel joke of all is that some of us are aware of our curse, and yet we do not even have the freedom to end it all. \nWe are trapped while an eternity flows by."
"That\'s deep, man... \n         \nYou could be a philosopher or a wizard for sure."
I just graduated from university and my first real engineering gig is at this huge castle! I\'m totally stoked! \nThe landlord is a bit of a twat though. He keeps going on about the master race and stuff like that. \nI hope he\'s just a troll and doesn\'t mean it.
You\'re working for them?! Voluntarily?! \nAre we supposed to not beat you up?
"Building weapons for fascists are where all the jobs are at these days, eh? \nGlad I enjoy being an unemployable peasant then. I\'m allergic to work."
"Anyway... see these cool booster tiles? I installed them! \nThey\'ll shoot you forward and you won\'t be able to stop until you hit something. Pretty cool right? \nI\'ve also built some magnetic boots that will let you stop on metal tiles, but I\'ve lost those somewhere. \nI still deserve a promotion in my opinion!"
Magnetic boots? \nWe need some stupid item to do some stupid puzzle?
"Well, you only need the boots to get some of those treasure chests, hehe!"
"Hey, should you be in here? \nAh, whatever. It doesn\'t matter. I have no loyalty to this regime. \nI\'m just here to do some research: These monoliths are incredible, they radiate immense amounts of energy! \nAnd suddenly they\'re appearing all over the world. Very odd."
So what are they exactly? \nAre they dangerous? \nAre they valuable!?
"We have no idea yet. We\'ve heard reports that a great portion of the southern continent has been wiped out by a meteorite.        \n\""The Great Impact\"" they call it... and the leftover crater is filled with these things. \nSo they\'re definitely coming from space. Maybe they\'re some kind of next level alien technology. I\'m very excited!"
"Ahhh, it\'s so warm and comfy in this suit. \nIts tender embrace fills my deep emotional chasms like no man ever has... \n\nH-huh?! Was I talking out loud again?"
Awkward...
"Anyway, we\'ve managed to create an energy field around the monolith to protect us from it\'s radiation. \nWe don\'t know what\'s powering that thing, but I think it\'s safe to assume that we should be careful."
"We\'re waiting to hear from our research team at the crater. \nHopefully they haven\'t all been raptured by space aliens yet. \nIt\'s a top secret communications line, so we\'re using snail mail - which is totally unhackable."
"What, you got news from the crater?! \nYeah, that confirms it - these invaders are from another world. \nWell, we\'ve studied their energy source, and invented this new magic skill..."
They\'re not just from another planet... they may be from another universe altogether. \nThese samples are unlike anything we\'ve seen before.
"Xavi at your service! Or, actually... maybe the other way round. \nI have a major favour to ask of you - I\'m trying to start a music business! \nBut I need some CDs to get started. Blank or pirated or whatever! \nOh, and watch out for bad people - there\'s a lot of them in here!"
Perfect! These are excellent! \nTime to start my perfectly legitimate business! \nI will offer the most authentic CDs out there! No scam at all!
"Who are you? \nI believe we\'ve never met, stranger."
"Shhhh, I\'ve snuck in here! Don\'t blow my cover!       \n\nI\'m looking for some sharp objects to do some damage with... "
Perfecto! \nI\'ll wreck this place and get the hell out of here before anyone spots me.      \n\nYou can have this stuff I found earlier...
Let\'s start with those banners...
"I was fighting off some undead monsters in the Mystic Woods, when BAM! \nThey grabbed me while my spells were cooling off. \nIf I had just a bit more time I could have gotten us out of here, so it\'s not like we needed your help or anything."
You\'re welcome.
"I was having a midnight snack when some men in black uniforms like barged into my house and swept me away! \nI thought it was all \""Just a prank, bro!\"", but I guess this was actually like a legitimate kidnapping! \nGosh I\'m kind of honoured, really, that I\'m like worthy of a kidnapping!"
I think she\'s still in shock from the whole experience...
"Their leader is like really cool though. \n\""Lance\"" I think it was?             \n\nHe\'s so tough and handsome! I want him for myself!"
"Noooooo, I think you\'ve got something wrong with your head now. \nDid they hit you or something?"
"I was minding my shop in Greenwood when I somehow got dragged into all of this. \nI was hoping to enjoy some time off, but I just ended up managing the resources in our prison cell.        \n\nTalk to the table if you wanna buy something."
We saved you and you\'re still gonna charge us?
(So rude!)
"Lance, my love! \nYou\'ve come to be with me again! \nI\'ve missed you greatly!"
(Oh it\'s this one again. \nI think I gave her the wrong idea when I kidnapped her. \nShe might be soft in the head...)
I fantasise about you every moment of every day! \nYou\'re so brave and wonderful! \nBeing apart only makes me yearn for you even more!
"Look, girl. I only needed you for your child rearing capabilities. \nThere is and never was any love between us. \nAnd since my plan was aborted prematurely, you are nothing to me. \n(Please don\'t sue me for my crimes.)"
"Ah, playing hard to get are we? \nThat\'s okay. I\'m sure you\'ll find your way back to me eventually. \nI\'ll be watching you from afar, always."
Eww.
Indeed.
"Oh... It\'s you again. \nYou got me. This is the exciting life I\'ve returned to.         \nSarcasm aside, thanks for saving me earlier."
"W-what?! You again! \nAre you guys the neighbourhood watch or something?! \nWhy ya making my life hard?! \nLike I said, I\'m innocent!"
We haven\'t accused you of anything yet! \n(But your clothes make you a tad suspicious...)
"Hey, Anna! Have you noticed? Doing sidequests is how you get new bonus skills! \nMonsters killed my scarecrow, and I gotta build a new one. \nI\'m just asking for a few bits of cloth, really..."
"Mighty thanks! \nI\'ll leave my barn open for you, and whatever crap I\'ve left in there can be yours if you want it.      \nOh, and Anna, your parents told me to remind you to use the Reflex skill sometimes."
I\'ve left my barn open for you. \nIt\'s just over there. \n*points to the left*
"Damned monsters took ma wooden planks. \nI\'m just tryin\' to build me a house like an honest dude, and I have to deal with this crap?! \nI dunno even how to swing a sword or nothin\'. \nAm doomed to suffer."
"Aww sweet, man! \nYou\'re gonna give me this wood? You\'re a real life saver! \nI can finally finish my house! \nIn return I\'ll tell you about this cool ninja kill-move I saw on TV."
"I reckon it\'ll be done by the time ya leave and come back, man."
"Yo, righteous dudes. \nI couldn\'t have built this house without ya.\nYou can rob me blind now if ya like, you\'ve earned it!"
Don\'t mind if I do!
But...          \nOh well.
My heart\'s not really into this whole archery thing. \nI\'d rather be making music... but Sarah\'s a demanding girl.\nMaybe she\'s not the one for me.
"Oh, an ocarina? \nIs this for me? \nI\'ll try to put some time aside to practice with this, thanks!"
"I hate my life, but playing music gives me some hope. \nMaybe things will get better someday..."
ROBOTS ARE ATTACKING!!
"Oh wow, you made quick work of them.... \nI could have used all of those experience points though. \nAnyway, it looks like they were stragglers from the Iron Fortress, probably lost their minds after the latest W*ndows update."
I\'ll never update my operating system ever again.
Kyyyyyyyaaaaaaaaaaaa!!! \nI\'m gonna call the guards! \nBurglar! Burglar!
Please forgive my rude companions - they can\'t control themselves. \nWe don\'t mean any harm! We\'re sorry!
Please don\'t talk to me - I\'m just taking a quick break to regenerate my concentration. \nI need to get back to studying soon.
"I\'ve read every book here, but there\'s not much point since they\'re all about fighting, and I rolled some terrible stats at birth. \nI\'d be killed instantly in a real fight!"
"Oh well, there\'s more to life than just fighting monsters."
"I\'m kind of jealous of you, Anna. \nBut damn, you brought back some weird friends this time!"
"Yeah, they\'re pretty weird alright. \n(I hope being weird is the worst thing they get caught doing..)"
"Heya! You\'re on a quest right? \nHave you had a look at the options menu lately? \nJust a friendly reminder that you can make the game easier or harder at any time, and change all sorts of other preferences!"
I like the option that protects my modesty...              \nBut I\'m probably the only one... \n*sigh*
I SAW WHAT YOU DID!
"H-huh? \nI ain\'t done nothin\'! \nWhat\'s your problem, man?"
I saw you stealing scrap metal from our workbench outside! \nYou can\'t lie to me!
Unclaimed items don\'t belong to anyone! \nThey\'re only yours if they\'re in your inventory!
WRONG! \nIn Greenwood we have property laws to defend against petty crooks like yourself. \nWe\'re not going to prosecute you for a small bit of steel... but we will increase our shop prices just for you. \nMaybe you\'ll learn a lesson here.
I will never change my ways!
*sigh*
Anna! You\'re back! \nStop wandering off like that. \nWill you and your friends be joining us for dinner?!
"Nah, we got somewhere we need to be. \n(Trying to save the world from evil monoliths actually, not that you would believe me.)"
"Well, play safely! \nI love you, dear!"
"I love you, too... \n(Don\'t patronise me in front of my team!)"
"(What\'s going on here?               \nIs this... a \""normal\"" family...?)"
"Ehhhh, are these your new buddies, Anna? \nThey got a look of trouble about them. \nCome talk to me if they try to force you to do anything dangerous."
They\'re... mostly fine. \nYou don\'t have to worry about anything. \nI\'ll keep them in line.
So which one\'s the boyfriend? \nIs it the homeless tramp or the school shooter?
"You what, mate?"
I ain\'t shot up no school yet!
"Er... we\'re going now! \nSee ya later, dad!"
"I\'m assuming you\'re skipping dinner again, Anna? \nOh well. I suppose you\'re an adult now. \nYeah, I\'ve heard all about your good deeds - they\'re in the news! \nYou and your pals are doing Godcat\'s work."
"Thanks, mom. \nGood luck with your renovations and stuff...            \nI\'ve saved up a lot of money, so just ask if you need anything!"
"Oh I could never take money from any of you! \nJust be careful out there, and good luck to you all!"
"Yes, miss."
"Thanks, Anna\'s mom."
Affirmative.
You visited the southern continent? \nI guess nothing I say has any effect on you if you\'re off doing dangerous stuff like that. \nNothing but bad news coming out of there lately.
"Dad we\'re doing really well, we\'ve got a lot of combat experience now. \nWe\'re on a mission to save the world and stuff!             \nBut you wouldn\'t understand..."
"Well if anyone hurts you, they\'ll have to deal with me! \nGwahahahaha! \n*almost has a heart attack*"
"Be careful and try not to strain yourself while I\'m gone! \nIf mom tries to make you clean the gutters, go hire that Lenk kid to do it instead. \nI don\'t want you falling off a ladder, ya hear me?"
"I\'m as hard as nails, gwahaha!"
"Sure you are, dad."
"This creep keeps bringing me junk he finds, like a cat or something. \nHe seems to always know where I\'m gonna be... maybe he works for Go*gle or something. \nTime to delete all of my social media accounts, I guess."
"It looks like every girl has to deal with someone really creepy, eh?"
Huh?        \nWhy are you looking at me?
"June is the love of my life! \nI got to know her by spying through her window for several months. \nI think things are really gonna take off between us, I just need to convince her that I\'m a nice guy and a loyal feminist ally!"
"Oh dear, poor June."
"Oh, a visitor! Welcome to Greenwood Library! \nWe\'ve got books on everything you\'d ever need to know! \nIf you want details about battle mechanics or other stuff, feel free to browse our collection! \nOur monster hunting series is particularly impressive-"
"Eh, I think I\'m fine just hitting things and seeing what happens."
"Don\'t be rude, Matt! \nWe could really use this opportunity to study and prepare ourselves! \nThere\'s a lot you won\'t be able to figure out with just brute force!"
You guys defeated the fascists? Thank Godcat! \nI thought I\'d be forced to hold them off on my own. \nThis town\'s been besieged by fascists on one end and monsters on the other. \nH-hey... why is their leader with you?!
I\'ve been... shamefully forced to retire. \nI\'m no longer your enemy.
You guys are heading into the Mystic Woods? \nI\'d advise against that unless you know what you\'re doing. \nIt\'s a labyrinth in there.
"We need to find the raft maker, and going through the woods is the only way. \nBut more importantly, I\'m going to protect my home from monsters!"
"I trust you, Anna. But these other guys you\'re with look a bit clueless..."
Eh?!
"Well anyway. \nThe woods contain two important treasures that will allow you to reach the raft maker\'s camp. \nKeep your eyes peeled for them - and good luck!        \nOh, and don\'t let the walking trees get you!"
There\'s no such thing as walking trees.        \nShe\'s just trying to scare us.
You found a raft? Good job! \nYou can have these leftovers if you want... I\'m already full.
"I broke a mirror and was cursed with bad luck! \nBut the thing is... I could have sworn that it was floating towards me, as if it were alive! \nThe weirdest monsters are coming out from the woods these days. \nSome backup would be nice..."
You there! You look like you know how to tame monsters! \nI need some punching bags to practice against - but I need something that won\'t die when I cut parts off. \nDo you know of any such beasts? I\'ll train them to be the best punching bags ever!
"Oh, slimes! But of course! \nThe next time we meet, I\'ll have trained these hideous beasts into beautiful punching bags."
"There are ninja all around you, always. \nYou just don\'t see them!"
"Hey Anna, meet my new boyfriend, Lenk! \nI\'m making him learn to hunt so that he can get me all the goodies! \nThere\'s a lot of treasure in the woods, ya know?"
"Eh, his aim doesn\'t look very good. \nAre you sure you\'re not stressing him out by expecting too much from him? \nHe\'ll leave ya if you work him too hard."
"Pfft, no way! \nLenk loves me unconditionally! \nHe\'ll do anything for me without question!"
Just try not to get him killed. \nHe\'s still a newbie with that bow...
"Huh, who the hell are you? \nYou think you can just walk into people\'s houses? \nGet the hell outta here!"
"Relax, old man. \nWe are... uh... the tax man!           \nWe just need to take a few things..."
Stick around and you might find out what we do with your kind around here!
"It\'s not just a phase - I really have no soul! \nMy parents refused to cater to my evil needs - so I ran away from home! \nBut I\'m getting kind of hungry now, and I\'ve got some wounds that need to be bandaged up..."
You guys are much better than my parents - they never gave me this much chocolate! \nThey also didn\'t let me sacrifice birds and rabbits.
One day I\'ll graduate from goth to necromancer. \nThat\'ll teach my parents not to look down on me!
What a horrible night to have a curse! \nHwa hwa hwa!
"Keep away from us, you weirdo!"
"PLEASE DON\'T IGNORE MY REQUEST!    \nAs you can see, I\'ve been forced by danger to take refuge in this hollowed out tree trunk. \nIf you could collect samples of good and evil energy for me, I\'d gladly teach you the incredibly useful Revive spell."
Hm.... I see... very interesting... \nThis is exactly the sort of samples I needed - here is the reward I promised. \nMay your adventures be blessed with good fortune for years to come.
This is a strange place indeed. \nLight and darkness battle over a delicate balance. \nWill there be a victor in the end? Only Godcat can know.
"Oh, it\'s you guys. \nLike I said earlier, I didn\'t really need your help. \nI can fight too - just look at the rough neighbourhood I live in!"
"I wouldn\'t invest in property in this area, that\'s for sure. \nLiving in a tree is as low as it gets."
Why is this maniac with you? \nIs he under a mind-control spell?
"Nah, he\'s just our prisoner now. \nIf he doesn\'t behave, he\'ll get the chop."
Pffft...
Oh! I know who you are! \nMy daughter has told me all about you. \nYou have my eternal gratitude for saving Bella.
Fighting foes and making the world a better place is what we do. \nIt\'s a pleasure to have been of service.
Is that right? \nI recall you spent most of your time just looting my castle... your goal was just plain thievery.
Anyway. You bunch are always welcome in our home. \nIt\'s rare to have company these days - visitors are always nice to have.
They say these woods are cursed... but everything looks fine to me. \nI\'m sure the guards were just trying to scare us so that they can pretend to be tough... everyone knows that ghosts aren\'t real! \nAll I see is a bunch of cats and other animals around here.
Just remember to follow the arrow signs if you get lost and don\'t know where to go!
I feel funny...            \nMaybe coming here was a mistake....
"I think we\'re witnessing a total party kill here. \nThey\'ve got status problems through the roof, yo."
Turns out the stories about ghosts were actually real. \nNo one could have predicted this... I take no blame for almost getting everyone killed.
We\'re on a pilgrimage to see all the shrines in the area! \nWe\'ll get mega inspiration points if we pray often enough. \nI\'m gonna ask the gods for unlimited ice cream.
I\'d ask for a bit more if I were you.         \n\nIt\'s all superstition anyway!
Rarrrr! Give me your bones!
No thanks!
"We made it out of the woods somehow, but I\'ll never forget what I saw in there. \nNo amount of ice cream will wash away the trauma."
"My friends don\'t believe in ghosts... but I do. \nMy aunt used to tell me about all sorts of voodoo magic. \nHaunted dolls and mirrors can play all sorts of tricks on the untrained mind. \nSometimes it\'s best to just walk away, pretend not to see them!"
Blargh!?
Her brain is fried... zombification isn\'t something we can cure. \nWe\'re gonna have to let them be for now...
I\'m not wandering out of town ever again. \nI\'d rather live a boring life than be cursed or killed by ghosts. \nIn fact I think I\'ll just stand right here for the rest of eternity.
Ya want something from our collection? \nYou\'ll need to find some keys! \nI promise our treasures will be worth it.
But we don\'t know what\'s in the treasure chests... isn\'t this some sort of illegal gambling operation?! \nWhat if we get scammed?         \n\nWhat if some guys on YouT*be make fake videos where they win stuff?
"Well... I shouldn\'t tell you this, but there are ways of cheating the system if you\'re really unhappy with your prize... \n*coughreloadyoursavecough*"
"In the end I\'ll collect \'em all, one way or another!"
Huh? What\'s this? Visitors? \nHow rare indeed! \n(Am I being robbed though?)
Are you the raft maker?! \nThe guy that makes floating contraptions?
"During my work hours - yeah, that\'s me. \nRight now, I\'m just having a beer and enjoying the view. \nI\'m just a guy."
We really need a raft to get to the southern continent - it\'s super urgent! \nWe need to investigate the meteor that fell over there!
"Hm, alright, alright. \nI figure rafts are in high demand now, so uh... I\'ll let you have my newest masterpiece. \nTake it and leave me in peace, I don\'t want any trouble."
Do we really look that troublesome? \nAre we starting to develop a bad reputation already?
You look like a bunch of flamboyant bandits. \nNo respect for the rules.
Fair enough.
"Anyway, with this raft, you can just walk off the end of any pier and float off to new lands. \nGreat stuff, but remember, you can only land on piers. Try it out!"
"You go home, forest our home!              \nTourists die here and now! Beware!"
Woah! Got a bit of a fright there! \nThanks for the warning... but we\'re gonna have to ignore it.
"Who there?! I no scare! \nI fight the foe, no fear! \nHeart is pure, head is smart!"
"If you\'re so brave, why are you hiding your face from us?"
Dark rock... it see all! \nRock is bad! Rock is spy!
Well he\'s definitely right to be suspicious of those monoliths. \nThey give me the creeps too...
"Flee now. Cat king is angry. Not good to anger cat king. \nCat king rule forest now, ever since great purge."
"What\'s that about a cat king? \nCats are lame and weak, there\'s no way they could hurt us!"
Cat king live at west edge of forest. \nYou die if go. Weaklings have no chance.
What you say?!
Only water-walker can reach. \nOnly walk on water with special boot. \nSpecial boot high in green tree - only ape can get!
"When cat king kills, soul is absorbed into body. \nCat king collect many soul over year. \nCat king is one and many, powerful army. \nWe worship by wearing bark of the cat king on face."
Cats don\'t have bark though...        \n...that\'s dogs.
"Nice to see ya again, travellers. \nWe planned to camp out here and protest environmental destruction, global warming, capitalism, and all that jazz, but... these woods are evil, man! Screw \'em! \nCut all the trees down!"
That\'s the spirit!
We can\'t even sleep \'cause we hear all these weird noises at night. \nWe wake up to find all this voodoo crap lying around... none of it ain\'t right.
That\'s not good. \n(I guess they won\'t be needing their stuff if they die...)
I ain\'t going back down there... but we\'re not safe here either! \nThis is turning into some bad horror film! \nMaybe if I share my last moments online I\'ll be remembered at least. \nI\'m sorry for screaming at you the last time we met - I don\'t want to die with regrets!
Meow!
My cat forgives you. \nI guess you\'re alright.
"Some old books say that this mountain is divine. \nLike, a god lives inside of it. \nNot sure how that\'s possible, and I\'ll probably never find out."
Why not just climb up there and have a look? \nYou look fit enough.
There\'s tons of powerful monsters around here. \nMy curiosity ends when my life is in danger. \nI am not a brave man.
"Don\'t be mad, but I followed you up here..."
One wrong move and you\'ll be killed by a dragon. \nMaybe you\'re braver than you think!
Maybe I\'m a dead man and it just hasn\'t sunk in yet!
"Did you find anything interesting, at least?"
The altar to the west of here seems to be some sort of input device for hidden codes. \nI wonder how that works...
"Steroids are the best. \nI may not look it, but I\'m super buff. \nNow if you\'ll excuse me... I\'ve got some more mushrooms to finish off."
(He\'s just buffing his laziness stat...)
"Yo, did you come here to see the monolith? \nThis is a good spot, man. \nIt feels like it\'s watching over us, keeping us safe from the dark forces at work. \nI feel a strong connection to the planet, man."
We suspect that these monoliths may be alien devices that are spying on us. \nI wouldn\'t relax around them.
"Nah, man. Mainstream media has fed you lies. \nThese aren\'t like the black mirrors in our pockets. \nKnock back a few beers and chill with us. \nExpand your mind and you\'ll find inner peace."
(I wish I could be as carefree as this guy.             \nMaybe it\'s all the drugs...)
"I\'ve mastered the waves, and I can teach you how to do it too. \nI\'ll need you to prove that you\'re worthy, by showing me some treasures of the sea."
"Ah, I think you\'re worthy. You can learn this new move now. \nWith this powerful Limit Break, you can surf at any time!"
Try not to wipe out any harbour towns with that surf attack. \nI don\'t want to be responsible for that.
"Welcome, fellow scholars. \nThis is the Rainbow Gate, and all around it is the realm of the sea god, Poseidon. \nIt\'s... a bit frosty in the southern parts."
"Woah, hold on, that\'s a lot of info to process. \nHow do we open this gate?"
"Oh, that... you\'ll have to put some skull-shaped artefacts onto the pedestals. \nOnce lord Poseidon is satisfied, the gate will open for you. \nThe artefacts are currently sitting idly among the little islands on this here river."
And this Poseidon guy... is he a friend or a foe?
"Oh, he\'s certainly most unfriendly. \nEver since we started dumping sewage in the river... he\'s been rather vengeful. \nHe\'s quite the menace to residents of Redpine Town - In fact they\'d very much appreciate it if he were to be forcefully pacified. "
Gotcha - that\'s the next boss then!
You pacified lord Poseidon? That\'s mega! \nBut being a learned scholar... I still have more hints to give!        \n\nFor example: Did you know that there\'s treasure at the end of each rainbow?
"That\'s just common sense. \nBut maybe we should put those stone skulls back where we found them, and see if any secrets are revealed..."
"A bunch of hippy stoners stole my flute! \nBut despite my tough appearance, I\'d like to avoid confrontations of any sort \'cause I\'m only 12. \nPerhaps a stealth mission is in order... and while you\'re at it I\'d like a snack too."
"Most excellent, chums! \nHere\'s some shiny things in return for your hard work."
These pink islands calm me - I think I\'ll build a house here someday.        \nThat temple over there is quite ominous though... 
"Your drill is the drill that will pierce the heavens! \nI\'ll teach you a new attack, if you show me your fighting spirit!"
"Aha, you\'ve earned this! \nUse this attack to penetrate your foes! \nIt works better if they resist and defend themselves!"
"If you believe in yourself, you can accomplish anything!                 \n(Or die trying...)"
"These waters are deadly. \nWater attacks just combo so well, you know? \nIf you get wet, you\'re super exposed to electricity and ice. \nAnd it looks like the sea-life has adapted to take advantage of that."
"Neutral status effects can be lethal if combined with certain elements. \nSometimes they\'re helpful, sometimes they\'re not."
"Yeah, sometimes it\'s best to just hide in backup for a while if you get wet - or any other sort of status effect. \nNo need to waste your turns or your life."
"Don\'t mind me, I\'m just hunting some fish. \nI smacked a squid really hard by accident, and it\'s arms fell off! \nThat\'ll teach \'em."
Giant squid are pretty tough. \nTheir ink effect can make things tricky too. \nGotta keep an eye on status effects.
I think they had another major weakness...          \nThough I can\'t quite remember what it was. Oh well.
"The wind blew away my popcorn. \nYup - you\'re gonna have to find every single bit of it in the Frozen Valley. \nI know you want to complete every quest, and I\'m going to exploit your dedication."
"Oh, you really did it. \nYou managed to track down every bit of popcorn? \nThat\'s kind of sad."
"I may just be an NPC, but I know how to troll the system. \nI\'m not going to make things easy for you."
"Me and Gina fled Redpine Town in a hurry when the monsters invaded. \nWe didn\'t really like it there anyway, that place was depressing!"
"Oh, was that when the meteor landed? \nIs your home okay?"
"The town\'s still standing, but probably not for long. \nWe\'re going to camp out here for a while and then settle down somewhere nice afterwards."
Redpine sounds like another mess we\'re going to have to clean up. \nIt\'s on the way to the impact site.
I don\'t think we should trust these deserters!
This is kind of embarrassing to ask but... I didn\'t have time to pack much supplies before running away from home. \nSo any food or clothes you can spare would help me out a lot.
T-thanks! These will do. \nI\'ll teach you a fiery spell that will help keep you warm...
Maybe trusting my sister was a bad idea after all. \nI should have stayed home.
I tried to fight Poseidon... but it\'s hopeless for someone like me. \nNow I\'m trapped in the valley and will probably freeze to death soon...
"We\'re gonna have to take care of him, one way or another. \nWe need to get to the next town..."
"Watch out for his freezing attacks - if you get wet you better play defensively, otherwise you\'ll end up frozen! \nAnd that\'s not all, he\'s got holy attacks too, and lots of little golems that self destruct!"
Got it. \nWe\'ll be careful.
W-what?! You guys are amazing! \nI can pass away in peace now...
Just use your legs and move to the next screen! \nYou don\'t need to die here!
"I lost my face in the blizzard. \nIt kind of just... froze off.                     \nMy spirits are high though, I\'m happy to be alive!"
"Good thing you have these captions, I guess. \nWe wouldn\'t be able to understand you otherwise."
"I\'m an ice mage, so I\'m over 100% resistant to the cold - it even heals me! \nBut that doesn\'t mean I can\'t still feel cold - and boy do I feel cold!"
"That makes you practically immortal around here, then. \nYou have no right to complain."
I can\'t feel my toes or fingers anymore. \nI can\'t tell if I\'m still alive or not. \nComing here was a mistake.
"Get outta here, before you die!"
"So if you combine the Chill and Wet status effects, you get Freeze. \nWish I knew that earlier. \nNext you\'ll tell me that Doom and Bad Luck combines to form Death, haha."
"Status resistance is becoming quite crucial at this point. \nBut we already knew that, right?"
"I\'ll take unfashionable equipment over freezing to death, that\'s for sure."
"I shouldn\'t be telling you this...             \nIt\'s kind of a secret, but..."
Spill the beans already! \nDon\'t hide things from us!
Well... there\'s items and quests you can only get around the time of certain holidays.
"Huh, really? \nWhat holidays are those?"
"Er... Valentines Day, Easter... and um... Halloween and Christmas."
"I don\'t celebrate any of those, so that\'s no good."
That\'s not... my problem?
Hohoho... don\'t tell anyone you saw me here. \nI\'m not in the mood this year.
"Your secret is safe with us, old man.        \nEnjoy your holiday!"
"Hahaha, they wanted to take our guns away! Can you believe that!? \nIf we had more guns, we wouldn\'t have been overrun by monsters. \nI tell ya, a bit more practice in here, and I\'ll be ready to liberate the town myself!"
(He\'s talking at the air next to me...            \n...I think he\'s actually blind!)
"Normally, I\'d have to shoot ya for breaking into here. \nBut under these circumstances, if ya need some weapons, go for it. \nWe need all the help we can get."
"We\'ll pay back everything we take, I swear!"
"Oh, I\'m sure you will..."
"I\'ve heard some very troubling rumours - this monster invasion is not our only worry. \nNo, there\'s something even more sinister going on behind the scenes. \nSome folk from town have ran off to join cults - what good could that possibly lead to?"
"Cults huh? \nIt looks like the world is ending around here, I\'m not surprised some want to place their beliefs in false promises. \nWho are they worshipping this time?"
"Not gods, I\'m afraid. They all believe the gods are dead! \nThere\'s two competing cults - one worships some ancient jewels, their purpose long forgotten. \nThe other believes that we live in a simulation, which is starting to crack and fall apart."
That sounds pretty out there. \nI\'m glad that I\'m sane.
We\'ve seen some strange things on our journey though. \nI wonder what secrets we\'ve missed? \nThese guys could be hiding among ordinary villagers!
"I\'m taking a risk being out here, but I gotta pay my respects to the fallen. \nWe lost half of our young men in the first attack, and many more civilians after that."
"Don\'t worry, I\'m sure you\'ll see your loved ones again soon. \nThe undead are popping up all over the place!"
Now\'s not the time to be joking about these things!
I\'m trying to cheer him up!
"Oh, it\'s you. \nPlease don\'t tell anyone about my past life. \nI\'m trying to put all that behind me."
"I don\'t even remember who you are, so I guess your secret is safe."
"L-Lance, is that you? \nMy love?"
N-no! \nI don\'t know you!
You\'ve got me mixed up with someone else...
I travelled all this way... to find you! \nAm I too late? Was it not meant to be?
"I\'d get a restraining order, but it looks like you\'re already crippled and unable to keep stalking me. \nI\'ll... buy you a drink for your troubles."
She\'s not old enough for that!
"While you were in the crater, these monsters flanked us and invaded the town again. \nThey\'re getting smarter, but I think we can still take \'em on!"
"Cheers, it looks like we\'re safe again!"
Order is slowly being restored. \nRedpine will get through this nightmare.
"Call me a coward if ya like, but am sailin\' outta here as soon as ah can. \nI\'ll need a lotta bottles... to store brew for the journey."
"Cheers, matey. \nWith these bottles I can sail off outta here. \nI don\'t wanna die on this Godcat-forsaken continent. \nI\'ll teach you one final skill before I go..."
"Oh right, Poseidon scuttled ma ship. \nI\'m doomed. \nSuicide by drink sounds like the way to go."
"Am growin\' some herbs down here. \nAh set me up a modern lightin\' system, ya see?"
Herbs for flavouring food or... the other kind?
"Huehue, hehehehe!"
At least he\'s enjoying the apocalypse.
"You\'re not supposed to be back here. \nOh, you knew that... and this is a robbery... in that case please don\'t hurt me!"
Sorry!
"Don\'t mind me. \nGhosts need to do shopping too, you know."
That\'s a very convincing floating trick...
"I was out in the woods, training for a big fight, when I heard a big explosion! \nAnd look! Someone destroyed my house! \nMy only hope now is... to find the Star Balls. \nWith those... I might be able to wish for my house back."
What?! You found the Star Balls for me?! \nI can wish for my house back now!
Time to make a wish... *sob*
"Whoops, I guess I got greedy and wished for a pile of treasure instead of a house! \nWell don\'t worry, I\'m gonna use it responsibly and invest in Bitcoin!"
You scammer! \nYOU NEED TO DIE!
"Yeah, we could have wished for world peace!     \n\nThis is the lamest thing you could have wished for!"
"LOL, my bad!       \nBut, ya know, there\'s no such thing as a free lunch, and all that!"
What a dingus...
"What a shame - I barely had time to dust off my old uniform before I heard the revolution was over. \nBut I\'ve still got the urge to see some bombs go off. \nHow about it, got any spare gunpowder? \nYou can trust me, comrade."
"Good work, comrade. \nYou\'ve done you\'re part of the mission, now I will carry out mine. \nSee you on the other side."
You need to go.
The meteor destroyed our farms and infrastructure. \nWe\'re taking whatever donations we can - to rebuild as soon as possible.
Are you donating this to the town? \nI\'ll be able to rebuild the wind turbines with this! \nThanks!
You\'ve done a very good deed. \nGood luck with your quest!
"I should be out there helping with the wounded, but I can\'t handle this anymore. \nNumbness is the only cure for these dark times."
"Hey, it\'s gonna be okay, we\'re here now! \nWe\'re gonna save the town!"
Who even are you? \nSome kind of tourist? \nThis ain\'t a town for tourists right now.
...
Oh? You\'ve cleared out some monsters? \nMaybe there is some hope after all. \nI should get back to drink... er... I mean work.
It\'s too late for Redpine. \nMonsters have settled in every crevice. \nIt\'s no longer safe to go outside. \nNothing left to do but drink my worries away.
What the hell? \nYou\'re giving up against a bunch of weak mooks? \nDo we have to always fix everything?
"Not everyone was born to be a hero, lady. \nDon\'t judge me."
*sigh*
"Oh, you\'re one of *those* types of people. \nWe installed the lock when we heard about you, but I guess you\'re very determined."
"I\'m so sorry, we\'ll pay you back when we finish our quest. \nI promise!"
(No we won\'t...)
"Welcome, stranger. This is a community of lost souls. \nIf you need spiritual guidance, feel free to join us. \nIf you\'ve been blessed with joy and plenty, a donation for those less fortunate would be appreciated."
Most appreciated. \nFolks like you keep this place going.
Why not join us for a spell? \nYou might hear some interesting stories.
"I\'ve learnt the truth about the world... we\'re all trapped in a simulation! \nOur actions aren\'t our own - we\'re just acting out a script, like lifeless golems! \nI\'m trapped in this game with no purpose, as infinite time passes. \nWhat a cruel existence!"
"What\'s this... magazines? Video games? \nIs this supposed to keep me distracted from the painful truth...? \nWell, maybe some entertainment will cheer me up. \nThis could make eternity slightly less sad."
"Life\'s not so bad... sometimes. \nI\'m still sad, but a little less than before."
"My thieving days are over. All I ever managed to do was get myself into trouble. \nThe rarest treasures are hidden away in some messed up dungeons, man. \nI don\'t want anything to do with that stuff anymore."
"Aha, so you were a thief, after all!"
"I\'m a reformed man now, you can\'t use that against me anymore. \nBut still, I am curious as to what\'s buried under the graveyard... \nNo! I can\'t think about that. \nThat way lies pure evil!"
"Huh, what exactly were you looking for?"
You\'ve never heard the legend of the 3 jewels?\nWell whatever. There\'s supposed to be a super-rare jewel buried in each town somewhere. \nBut I only ran into trouble - I\'m done with that.
I wonder if this is legit?          \n\nShould we even trust this guy?
"No job, no money, no food. Why even bother? \nIf there\'s a way to reset the system, maybe I\'ll be reincarnated into more fortunate circumstances."
"It could be much worse, dude. \nWhat if you were reincarnated as a slime?"
"Being a mindless beast would be great! \nThe brain is the real engine of suffering, after all. \nEliminate the brain, and we are free - life begins."
YOU!
Me?
"You look like you\'ve seen a lot, but I bet you haven\'t witnessed the real truth yet. \nThere\'s things in this world of ours that we will never understand. \nGlitches in the matrix, errors in our dreams, fluctuations in space-time."
You\'ve lost me now.
"Visit the Rainbow Gate once more, and present before it the symbol of the Illuminati. \nA secret will be revealed. \nYou can\'t explain that - it\'s beyond human comprehension!"
"Hordes of evil minions have invaded Redpine, but I fear the fiercest beasts are yet to come. \nI\'ll make my stand here, at this bottleneck, til the end of my days. \nWith some additional resources, I could erect a palisade wall, and hold out a bit longer."
"With warriors like yourselves, we can win this war against evil."
"Redpine will prevail! \nWe\'ll push the monsters back! \nThe town is now protected, you can move forward without worry!"
Everyone who can still fight to defend the town is positioned here. \nAs you can see... there\'s not a lot of us. \nIt seems that Godcat has forsaken these lands.
Lava samples. I need them. \nAnalysis under a microscope can tell us where the meteor came from. \nNothing solid left of it. It all melted on impact.
Perfect. I\'ll package these up and....          \nHere we go. Please deliver this back to the lab in the Iron Fortress. \nThey have the equipment required to analyse these samples.
Outlook not so good. \nIt may be as I fear... this could be an alien invasion. \nThese monsters are not normal.
I\'m just some guy.           \nWaiting to die.
Was that... an intentional rhyme?
"As I stand here, I waste breath.            \nI simply long for, my sweet death."
*Cringe*
"Welcome, to the Doomsday Battle Arena! \nAre you willing to participate in a fight to the death, purely for the entertainment of the crowd?"
We just need to get through here. \nYour little vanity project is in the way - and you don\'t even have a crowd!
This is it - the apocalypse is happening now! \nThere\'s no time to think about the future - we all need to live in the moment! \nSpend all of your money! Gorge yourself on steroids! \nMax out everything!
"Oh, I already lived that way. \nI\'m ready!"
"He\'s right though, there\'s no point in hoarding resources anymore. \nWe should spend whatever we need to and upgrade our favourite equipment."
"The end is nigh for us all. \nAre you at peace with yourself? \nCan you truly say you\'ve lived a virtuous life, true to your values?"
I wasted a lot of my life playing video games.               \nBut that\'s okay \'cause it was fun. \nI have no regrets!
"I\'ve killed many innocent NPCs, and made many more homeless... but now I see that playing the hero is much more rewarding than playing the villain. \nPerhaps this is the path I should have followed all along.                   \nI definitely regret much of what I\'ve done."
I never had a chance to grow those herbs that my parents wanted. \nMaybe I should have put aside more time to spend with them.
Stop with the confessions! \nWe\'re not going to die!
Who would have known the end of days would come with a tidal wave of pink water and red skies?\nIt\'s so beautiful.
"Hey, it\'s not the end just yet. \nWe\'re still going to fight and protect the world."
I\'ve spent my life waiting for the rapture - the Book of Catus was adamant that it would come. \nAm I worthy to ascend to the heavens? Or will my soul be permanently deleted? \nI\'m ready for whatever happens.
"We\'re not going to find many allies around here, huh?"
This situation is indeed sub optimal.
"I - the great wizard Randalf - was wrong about you youngsters. \nI never could have imagined that you would make it this far and so fast. \nIn only a few days, you\'ve become immensely powerful."
"That\'s the appeal of RPGs though isn\'t it? \nThat exponential increase in power as you slay monsters, find equipment, and level up. \nIt\'s real satisfying."
"What\'s an RPG? \nOh, you wacky kids and your hip new fads!"
"Heya! We meet again! \nYou kids have come a long way - last we met you were mere scrubs, scurrying around trying to find your feet! \nYou\'ve sure grown!"
I can\'t tell if that was a compliment or not?
It\'s bleak around here - folk are looking a tad desperate. \nBut there\'s always hope - and it seems to follow you lot around.
Meow!
"Hey, warrior-type people! \nYou look like you\'ve collected a few Golden Tickets on your journey so far. \nNow\'s the time to cash out - the final battle is approaching! \nLet\'s use them together and call in some backup!"
Radical! \nThe Warrior\'s Guild should send us some free gear right away. \nThey usually deliver in just a few minutes!
Give me a second!
Check out all this gear we got form the Warrior\'s Guild! \nYou can take whatever you need - it\'s time to get ready for the final battles!
They sent us all of this?! \nLooks expensive!
"I tried to absorb the power stored in these crystals... but it just turned my skin red. So much for that. \nI got so mad that I dropped my Big Hammer - yeah, it\'s much bigger than that little thing you\'ve got."
"Big Hammer, huh? \nGuess we\'ll need that at some point to get through these red crystals."
"You guys can do it, even if you don\'t believe in yourselves. \nYa know why? Cause I believe in you! \nSo place your belief in me, who believes in you!"
"We barely even know you, bro. \nThanks anyway, we\'ll give it a shot."
"Remember to use that attack I taught you! \nUse your drill, and you\'ll be just fine!"
"My village sent me to give you guys some supplies. \nWhen we heard that someone from OUR HOME ISLAND was gonna stop the alien invasion, we had to lend support somehow."
"Thanks, Wohehiv. \nPlease make a totem pole for us if we die!"
"You can do it. I saw you fight. \nNo one else matches you in power and technique. \nIf you fail, our world is doomed."
Thanks for putting so much pressure on us...
"Thanks for your help earlier, now I\'ve come to repay the favour and support you through the final battle. \nIt\'s easy for us to get here since you\'ve unlocked all of the slime cats now. \nYou\'ve really done so much for us."
"Thanks, Molly. \nI think we\'ll get through this!"
You can do it!         \nDo what exactly? I do not know. \nBut you youngsters hold the key to the future.
Shouldn\'t you be resting?
Nonsense! \nMissing the final battle would kill me!
"Hey, what you guys did for me really saved my life. \nWe all gotta do what we can for this little simulated world of ours. \nNone of us have to suffer alone. \nI\'ll be rooting for ya."
Glad you\'re doing better. \nWe\'ll make this a world worth living in again.            \nI promise!
Together we stopped the fascist revolution. \nTogether we can also stop this catastrophe!
Are you the guy who vandalised my fortress...?!
"N-no, sir."
"Hey, why are you guys sober? I\'ve got an offer for you! \nFor a limited time I\'ll trade you some warm seasonal clothes in exchange for some candy. \nSounds good, eh?"
That\'s the spirit! \nMay the flying fat man bless you all and fill your stockings with alcohol.
My work here is done. \nTime to drink until I pass out.
TRICK OR TREAT!       \nYOU GIVE ME MONSTER CANDY... AND I LET YOU LIVE!!!    \n(Please don\'t hurt me.)
"VERY GOOD, HUMANS. \nHERE IS SOMETHING EVIL IN RETURN. \n(Now you can dress up too!)"
Good haul this year - should feed me until next year. \nBut how do I get home from here? How did I end up in space?
"I\'m a simple bunny person, and I love chocolate. \nIf you don\'t have anyone else to give chocolate to this year, then consider giving it all to me! \nI\'ll give you a special surprise in return. *wink*"
"Thanks, person! That\'s a lot of chocolate! \nAs I promised, here\'s your special surprise!"
"Ahhh, I\'m so satisfied. \nLife is lovely - what a view!"
"Heya there stranger, do you want to feed my Easter egg addiction? \nIt\'s that time of the year, when monsters start laying chocolate eggs. \nIf ya collect a bunch of them for me, I\'ll give ya something nice in return."
"Oh my! They\'re so fresh. These are fabulous. \nAs I promised, here\'s some nice gear for ya in return for the eggs."
Enjoy your holidays and all that. \nI\'ll be fattening myself up while watching the stars go by!
"I am Odin, the guardian of this holy spirit realm. \nFeel free to come and go as you wish.              \n\nHowever, there is one slime cat I cannot allow you to touch, as it leads straight to the temple of hell in the lake of fire."
Really? \nYou don\'t think we can handle it?! \nOr are you just keeping some secret treasure for yourself?
"Oh, primitive child! \nOnly legendary heroes who have defeated the five super bosses of all four optional dungeons can pass here. \nThe greatest challenges of all lie beyond this point. \nAt your current level, you would be slain immediately."
"Brave and powerful warriors, I am humbled by your presence. \nPlease, pass through this slime cat if you wish. \nI am confident that you can face any challenge beyond this point."
"Yeah, we\'re finally getting the respect that we\'ve always deserved!"
Now let\'s not get too arrogant. \nThere\'s still bosses out there that could finish us off.
...
Do you want me to read your fortune? \nGive me your hand and I\'ll read your mind!
"Ew, that\'s kind of gross. \nPlease stay away from me."
"Alright, here we go..."
"Matt seems to be oblivious to the feelings of others, especially girls. \nThis isn\'t good for Natalie."
I can sense a lot of tension between Natalie and Lance - there\'s some bad blood there! \nDid something happen between them?
"Anna and Lance don\'t seem to know each other very well, but they\'ve got more in common than they realise. \nMaybe they should try fighting together sometimes."
"Natalie could be like a big sister to Anna, but for some reason they see each other as rivals."
"Matt and Anna have similar personalities, meaning that they\'re both childish and need to grow up."
Lance feels threatened by Matt\'s popularity. \nPerhaps he should try to learn from him instead.
Oh... I can\'t seem to detect any gossip. \nYou guys must get along very well!

"Oh no, it\'s more of these guys...            \nLooks like they still don\'t want to talk to us."
...
...
What\'s up with this guy? \nHe\'s standing around like he\'s expecting something important to happen here later.
...
WOAH! \nThere\'s someone else in here!
Let\'s get out of here!
...
"Too good to talk to us, eh?           \nWell, whatever. \nYou creep me out anyway!"
HERE LIE NIGHTMARES.        \nTURN BACK NOW.
It can speak!           \nThat doesn\'t sound very good though.

"Hey, there\'s an optional dungeon this way! \nUnfortunately you can\'t access it unless you pay up some real-life cash. \nYou\'ll need to purchase the Deluxe version of EBF5 - which is basically an expansion pack - and then I\'ll move out of the way."
So are you literally a pay-wall? \nDo you only exist to torment us?
"I guess you could put it that way. \nI\'ll never be respected, but at least I can do my job honestly.            \nAnyway, I\'m gonna hand you this digital leaflet that explains everything...."
Here you go. \nThere\'s a link on there you can click.
"Oh hey, since you\'ve got the Deluxe version of EBF5, I can let you into this secret optional dungeon! \nBut beware, it\'s a bit harder than the stuff you\'ve done so far, and you might be better off coming back to it once you\'re further along in your adventure. \nGive it a try and see!"
"Please don\'t do anything reckless like opening these gates. \nThey exist for a reason, you know. \nThere\'s powerful monsters in there!"
Challenge accepted!
"They say I\'m not intimidating enough to be a guard. \nI was hoping words and logic would be enough to keep people away from this place, but I guess not."
"Ahhh, yes... are you here to study the ruins also? \nThere\'s something very magical going on here - fire and ice cannot coexist naturally."
Can you tell us how to solve this puzzle? \nThat\'s all I need to know from you.
"Well... I think I\'ve got it figured out. \nBut I do want the treasure for myself, so I can\'t really give you any clues, now I can I?"
I\'m doomed to suffer in an endless hell of block puzzles. \nWhy is this my life?
Fine... I\'ll give you a clue... \nYou can push the blocks to move them!
YOU THINK THIS IS JUST SOME GAME?!
Do you think I can do it? \nDo you think... I can surf on lava?
"If your board is resistant to fire, I don\'t see why not? \nJust make sure to film it... it would be a waste to die for nothing."
I\'m too weak to move these blocks... not that it would matter anyway. \nThe puzzles in here are too hard for me... \nI had a brief look at the boss though!
Yeah?         \nWhat can you tell us about the boss?
"Not much, they\'re ice and fire elemental, as you would expect. \nIf you don\'t have the gear to deal with them yet, you can always come back later."
Them? They?        \nSo there\'s more than one boss?
I\'ve been tasked with protecting Lance\'s underground bunker - only adventurers that have purchased the EBF5 Deluxe Version are allowed into this top-security optional dungeon.
"I\'m right here, moron. \nI\'m the guy you\'re working for! Let me in!"
"No sir! You told me not to let anyone in, not even yourself! \nI can\'t allow you to enter. \n\nBut here\'s some more information for you..."
"You see, this is already a complete game, but you can buy this expansion pack if you want even more stuff!              \n\nPlease don\'t hurt me..."
"Ah, I see you have the EBF5 expansion pack. I\'ll let you into this optional dungeon then...       \nBe warned though - it\'s a maze in there! \nIf you get lost, just save and load your game - you\'ll appear back at the entrance.          \n\nDon\'t forget this!"
"Woah! Are ye a friend or a foe?! \nGlad I packed as much guns as I did, only thing keepin\' me alive down \'ere. \nI figured the entrance done collapsed."
"Nah, it\'s still possible to get out. \nYou really don\'t want to live down here, you\'ll go mental."
"I can\'t leave, I haven\'t found all the treasure yet!               \nOr any treasure at all for that matter..."
"Oh my lord, a human face! \nI was once an adventurer like you, but I\'ve given up trying to escape this mine - I always end up back where I started. \nThis is my home now. I live off the condensation and scum on the walls. I defecate in a bucket."
"Woah, how long have you been down here?!"
I think it\'s been three or four hours now.
Are you here to rescue me?! Thank the lord in heaven! \nI thought I was going to be crushed to death!
That was an epic battle to witness. \nYou have truly been sent by the lord. \nI thank you for saving my life.
I wasn\'t so sure we were gonna make it either... but I\'m glad you had faith in us.
"Oi, you can\'t come this way. \nThis passage is reserved for zombies only, and also for people who own the expanded version of this game... \nEr... the Deluxe Version or something like that."
You\'re gonna put a paywall in front of a filthy zombie cave? \nWell I don\'t feel like we\'re missing out on much.
"This is my home, don\'t disrespect - humans are filthy also!               \nHere\'s some more information, if puny human is interested..."
"These new dungeons... they\'ve some hard puzzles... hehe... \nThe boss is tough too, but those puzzles are cruel..."
"*sniff, sniff*          \nYou not a zombie, but you get lucky pass this time. \nI have been ordered to let in those who own the full version of this game."
We\'re... very honoured?
"I... I\'m starting to crave... human meat. \nOh, I shouldn\'t have come down this way - they all warned me! \nNow something is seriously wrong with me..."
Let\'s move along. \nThe next person she meets can explain it to her.
Or put her out of her misery...
"Hmmm, you\'ve come far, feeble little humans. \nAre you not wandering too deep? \nWe\'ve got a taste for your kind down here..."
Don\'t even try it!
Maybe just a nibble then?
"I\'m trying out this cool new diet...          \nI can eat whatever I want, but not meat, or eggs, or anything I actually like."
I don\'t think you\'re going to survive for very long with that sort of diet.
Uguu~
Huehuehue. You\'ll never solve this! \nBut I\'ll give you a little tip... the solutions are right before your eyes!
"You cursed beast, you deserve to suffer for constructing such evil contraptions!"
"(I wonder if it would be inhumane to kill zombies. \nThey\'re clearly sentient, and kind of like people. \nBut they\'re also evil!)"
"Well unlike you, I\'m not a sadist, so maybe I can tell you a little more...         \nThe order you activate the switches in doesn\'t matter, all that matters is the final combination! \nPay attention to the symbols and follow their flow!"
"This is an optional dungeon, and you know the drill. \nYou\'ll need to purchase the Deluxe Version of EBF5 to get in here. \nIt\'ll be worth it, I swear. There\'s two bosses in this one!"
"That\'s lame.       \nWe\'re fighting to save your town, and we still can\'t get in for free?"
"Sorry, them\'s the rules. \nThere\'s a link to the expansion pack on the title screen if you\'re interested, and here\'s a little leaflet about it..."
"If you ever finish everything in the free version, you can always get a little bit more content for yourself..."
"Oh hey, since you\'re a cool guy who owns the full version of EBF5, I can let you into Redpine\'s secret cave system. \nThere\'s a lot going on down there, and maybe you can make some sense of it."
"Heya, these caverns are amazing! \nThere\'s hidden passages all over the place. \nThere\'s treasure under every boulder!"
"Feel free to \""find\"" treasure. \nJust make sure you leave it for us where you find it, okay?"
"This puzzle is impossible. \nI should be collecting gems, but I just keep staring at this thing, and trying to solve it.                      \nIt\'s a real mind bender."
How far have you gotten?
I\'m too weak to even push the blocks. \nThey must weigh over a ton!
"We\'re not the only ones collecting crystals for their energy. \nThere\'s plenty of monsters down here too, because of course there are.               \n\nThere\'s always damn monsters around... *sigh*"
"And they don\'t even give EXP down here!           \nSigh, indeed."
"This old temple seems to be extracting power from these crystals without destroying them. \nWe usually just burn them for heat, so maybe we\'ve got a bit to learn when it comes to renewable energy."
Where\'s all of this crystal energy going?
"That\'s probably not relevant to the plot at all, and neither am I."
"I can\'t breathe over here, it\'s so hot! \nFreakin\' monsters aren\'t helping either. \nI\'ve been down here all day and-"
What happened to your eye?
(That\'s very rude!)
"Turns out a drill-spear is like a double-edged sword. \nYou can thrust it through the rocks, or just trip and fall on it yourself. \nI didn\'t get a lot of training with this thing due to budget cuts."
You see this temple? This is it! The ultimate challenges lie in here! \nThis is where the golden slime cat leads to!
"Let me guess... we need to pay to get in there, because you\'re a scumbag?"
"Exactly! This is the final dungeon in the Deluxe Version! \nYou have to beat all the other dungeons to get in here! \nThe Evil Players reside in here... and they\'re a unique bunch, for sure! \nAnyway, here\'s that ad, one more time..."
"If you\'re still not convinced, you could always wait for a sale or something..."
"Aha, you\'ve done it! \nYou\'ve faced your inner evils and triumphed!"
"Yeah, that was crazy back there.           \n\nBut... uh... what do we do now?"
"Unfortunately you have broken the order of events that the developer intended! \nYou see, he expected you to have beaten all of the mini-bosses by now!            \nSo you must return here once you\'ve beaten the 3-headed Zombie Hydra!"
Oh.       \n\nOkay then.
"Ah, the heroes of Epic Battle Fantasy have arrived at last!  \nI present before you these final challenges, which will hopefully satisfy your lust for prestige and honour!"
Who the hell are you?
"Before you are 5 glowing orbs - each represent an enormous challenge! \nThe first on the left is the \""Foe Marathon\"", a lengthy battle where you must face off against every regular foe in the game. The second orb from the left is the \""Miniboss Rush\"",  where you must defeat this game\'s lesser bosses one after another."
"The orb furthest to the right is the \""Mega Boss Rush\"", and the second from the right is the regular \""Boss Rush\"". As the names imply, you must face off against this games bosses one by one, without any breaks in between. You\'ve beaten them all before, so this should be no problem for you at all!"
"Heh heh, I hope so."
"And finally, in the middle, we have the \""Endless Battle\"". In this ultimate endurance test, you will try to survive as many waves of random foes as you can, while enemy levels gradually increase. The game difficulty will be automatically set to Hard for this one battle, and your high-score will be recorded in your records menu."
It\'s achievement-hunting time!
