"I\'ll just take a quick nap for now, BRB."
The ground suddenly looks so comfortable... maybe a quick break... bleh...
"F-fight me again... best 2 out of 3... come on, square go...                 \n\nBleh..."
"Matt, get back up! \nI need you to take those hits for me!"
"Hmph, better him than me. \nHe can sleep that off."
I guess Matt\'s not invincible after all. \nCould have fooled me.
M-meow!
"Matt, are you okay?! \nDon\'t die like this!"
"Hey, get up. The battle\'s not over yet. \nWe won\'t leave you behind."
"Woah, knocked clear off his feet.   \nThat\'s gotta hurt."
M-m-m-meow! \n*cowers in fear*
S-sto- KYAAAAAAA!!!
"I wanted to die at home, surrounded by family!      \n\nWhat a pain!"
"Please donate my body to science. \nOr whatever\'s left of it, anyway."
"Oh snap, should I have prevented that? \nAm I bad bodyguard?                 \n\nNah, no one could have predicted that!"
(I guess Natalie\'s airbags don\'t offer much protection after all. She seems to bruise easily...)
(That\'s what you get for turning me down. Maybe I can forgive you now.)
"*angry, protective hiss*"
"Whoops, I let Natalie down again. \nCan\'t beat myself up about it though.                \n\nI\'ll try harder next time!"
"Hey, get bent! \n(No one knocks out my fantasy wife like that!)"
Hey! Try picking on someone your own size! \nI\'m over here!
*hisses like a venomous snake being decapitated*
"Don\'t tell people how I died. \nOh, the shame!"
Remember me as- AAAAAARGGGHHH!
Don\'t let me die in vain! \nWin this battle for me!
I think Lance had a heart attack from all those cigarettes...
Well that was cathartic.. and very satisfying.             \nCan we let him lie there for a while?
Can\'t say he didn\'t deserve that...                \nHe definitely deserved that.
*secretly enjoyed watching Lance die*
I think the batteries died on his wireless keyboard.
"As much as I like to watch Lance suffer, we kind of need him alive now..."
"Oi, you can\'t do that! \nLance may be a bumhole, but he\'s OUR bumhole!"
*laughs internally*
Ugh! No time to think of last words!
You better avenge me or I\'ll come back to haunt you!
I\'m off to visit my ancestors! \nBut I\'ll be back!
Now\'s not the time for a nap. \nYou can rest later.
Anna! \n(Don\'t leave me alone with these brutes! I need you here!)
War is no place for little girls. \nLet this be a lesson to you.
*reality hits him like a ton of bricks*
That blow could have knocked over an elephant!
"Come on Anna, I was starting to like you. \nDon\'t let me down now!"
Death comes for us all eventually. \nHe\'s just a stray bullet away.
*suddenly doubts life choices*
N-nyaaaaaaaaaa!
M-m-m-m-m-m- \n*regrets everything*
*realises that life is suffering*
"Oi, no one hits my cat except me! \nYou\'ll pay for that!"
"NoLegs, no! \nI\'ll give you extra treats after this battle!"
"Pffft, we can always get a new cat. \nThere\'s tons of strays about."
"Nooooo, what happened to your cat instincts? \nI thought you could dodge like a ninja?!"
"Picking on the little guy, eh?! \nWhy don\'t you try facing me instead, huh?!"
NoLegs is too pure for this world. \nHe doesn\'t deserve to suffer like this.
"Rest in peace, furball. \nNot even a cat deserves to die like a rat."
You only hit NoLegs because he was distracted by your ugliness. \nHe won\'t make that mistake again.
My power nap is complete! \nI\'m ready to jump back into battle!
My neck is really sore. \nThat wasn\'t the most comfortable sleeping position...
"Why are the foes still here? \nYou can\'t win without me, huh?"
Did I... drink too much or something?\n I don\'t remember anything at all.
I\'ve been blessed with unlimited continues! \nI won\'t stay down!
Good to have you back. \nBe more careful this time - I need you alive!
Nyahahaha!
My clothes are dirty and my hair is messed up. \nWhat a crappy day!
"Woah, where am I? \nWhy do I feel hungover?"
I\'m starting to get used to this weird sensation of dying and being brought back. \n
Don\'t look so gloomy. \nI\'m okay now.
That was nothing! \nI feel good as new!
"I\'m sorry if I\'ve let you down, Natalie. \nI won\'t let them get you again."
"Great to have you back, Natalie. \nYour presence is good for my morale and blood flow."
That took me back to my days sleeping in the trenches. \nThe rest was sub-optimal.
I see that the war isn\'t over yet. \nLet\'s push forward.
"I\'ll just have a smoke real quick.                          \n\nJust give me a second, okay?!"
"Bah, that was just a scratch. \nI was just playing dead."
Which one of you punks interrupted my dream?! \n(Her clothes were about to come off...)
"Get up, bro! \nWe got this one!"
We\'re only letting you live because we need to win this battle. \nDon\'t think I\'ve forgiven you.
"Just a minor setback - how embarrassing! \nI\'m fine, really!"
"Nice try, foes! \nBut see, I\'m still coming to get ya!"
"Ooops, did I pass out again? \nDid I miss much?"
"It\'s okay, heaven sent me back \'cause I was too cute for \'em!"
Did ya\'ll miss me? \nI plan on sticking around!
I didn\'t think you\'d get back up after that blow. \n*sarcastic clap*
Did you enjoy your nap?
Meow!      \n*appears to say thanks*
*shrugs it off*
"*returns from heaven, back to hell*         \nM-m-meow??"
*returns from his catnap*
"Nyaaaa!       \n*cats have 9 lives, yo*"
"No slacking off, NoLegs!      \nI continue to feed you for a reason."
"Go get \'em, NoLegs!      \nYou can do it!"
I guess fruit is acceptable.       \nI shouldn\'t complain.
"That was the worst thing I\'ve ever eaten, and I have no standards.     \n\nWas that even food?!"
"Mmmmm, crunchy metal can, full of zinc and iron."
Pizza is my post-workout power food. \nNothing builds muscle mass faster.
*buurrrrp!*
"Hey, this is the diet version, right?          \n\nSeriously though, this is important!"
(Eating during a battle might not be the best thing for my sensitive stomach...)
(A small sip can\'t hurt. I\'m not going to get addicted again.)
"Oh god, that\'s probably 3,000 calories going straight to my gut.    \n\nI\'d rather die!"
What even-!!!     \nWWWWHHHYYYYY?!?!?! 
"Not sure what that was, I ate it without looking."
A good choice. \nThat counts for one of my 15 daily power drinks.
"This food is so fresh, how very strange. \nI thought food only came in cans and ration packs."
I\'ll burn that off in no time at all.           \n\n(Or puke while trying...)
I SHOULDN\'T HAVE EATEN THAT!!!!!      \n\nWhat have I done?!
Delish! \nI need more!
So tasty - what is this?! \nWhat kind of tree do these grow on?
W-what is this? \nI feel ill...          \n\n...and a bit dizzy!
"I can feel my fatness stat skyrocketing suddenly. \nIf I ate any more of that, I\'d be immobilised...     \n\nWorth it though!"
"Ooooh, that\'s... THAT\'S SPICY!!!            \n\nWhen does the burn stop?!?!"
"*this isn\'t meat, is it?*"
"*more, please*"
Meow...?!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?
*feeling a little bit hyper*
"If that attack were any weaker, it would have healed me!"
"Is that all ya got, foe? \nTry dealing some decent damage!"
I almost feel bad fighting such weaklings now. \nIt\'s not rewarding to beat up defenceless foes.
Why are these wimps even trying to fight us? \nThey\'re just feeding us with EXP!
"What are you hoping to accomplish, foe? \nYou\'re just filling up my Limit Break faster."
"Hey, come on now! \nThere\'s no need to get violent!"
Leave me alone - attack someone else!
H-hey! Don\'t touch me! \nYou\'ll mess up my hair!
"I might spare you if you surrender right now, foe. \nDon\'t throw your life away."
I can\'t believe I tried to be a vegetarian once. \nSome monsters don\'t deserve to be saved.
Why are you attacking ME!? \nYou\'re dead now - you can count on it!
"Pfft, girls have slapped me harder than that!"
Are we done warming up? \nAre you ready to take a serious swing at me?
"That was nothing, my dad hit me harder than that!"
"That was your chance to finish me off, and you just wasted it. \n\nYou won\'t survive to try again!"
"Did you even finish your battle training, foe? \nOh, you didn\'t even get any? \nThat figures."
"Don\'t even try it, foe. \nI have the high ground!"
"If you leave a mark on my pretty face, you\'ll regret it!"
"Don\'t you have any remorse attacking a young, innocent girl like that?!"
I got hit in the boob! \nGrrr.
"I\'ll teach you some manners, stupid foe! \nJust you wait and see."
"Go home and be with your family, foe. \nYou\'re not cut out for this."
*not impressed*
Nya nya nya...
*slightly tickled*
Meow?
*disappointed*
I\'ll make a point to move out of the way next time...
I shouldn\'t have tried to block that attack with my crotch.
"You got some beef with us, foe?! \nWell make sure you finish me off or you\'ll regret it!"
That was some smash move! \nLaunched me right out off the screen!
YA DINGO DINGUS!
GET DUNKED ON!!
KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!
Eeeep!
My lunch is coming up...
My ovaries just imploded!
Don\'t do that again!
I\'m not going to let you walk all over me like that!
*gasp*
You douche nozzle!
SH*TBIRD!!
Son of a motherless goat!
I\'LL SHOVE A CACTUS UP YOUR *SS!!
I\'LL NUKE YOUR WHOLE FAMILY!!
Seven hells!
Wood goblins will get ya!
Son of a squirrel!
Nuts and eggs!
Rancid butter!
CURSES UPON YOU!!
!!!

"I know I still get EXP and loot when I\'m on the bench, but I\'d rather work for it!"
I have been summoned! \nI see targets to stab!
Am I being cast aside? \nI thought I was the main character!
"B-but, I\'m like a shark! I can\'t stop moving! \nSitting this one out is going to be painful for me!"
You guys interrupted my game of T*tris! \nI almost got to see the rocket launch and everything.
I was in the middle of a game! \n(Stupid Donkey K*ng is going to win the race...)
"I\'ll gladly sit this one out, if you don\'t mind taking care of it..."
"My phone\'s fully charged, and I\'ve got stuff to do. \nKeep those foes busy for me."
Reporting for duty with heavy weapons charged!
"Orders, now! \nTell me what to obliterate!"
"Pffft, you think you can manage without me? \nWe\'ll see how that goes..."
"I wanted to finish them off, but I guess orders are orders.       \n\nI\'ll keep the bench warm."
These guys don\'t look scary at all! \nLet\'s take \'em on!
You really need my help against these things?
"Fine, I\'ll try to chill for a moment. \nDon\'t leave me off for too long, okay?"
"Awwwwww, my turn\'s over already?"
Meow!
Nya!
*meh*
Meow?
LET ME AT \'EM!! \nDON\'T TRY TO STOP ME!
I\'LL BITE THEIR HEADS OFF!! \nWHO WANTS SOME?!
Why is there a question mark above my head? \nAm I confused?                 \n\nShouldn\'t that always be there then?
Screw the battle - I need food.              \n\nI\'m just gonna grab a quick snack.
Huh? \nI look a bit... different?
Ack! \nI can\'t see my own life bar anymore! \nThis is unfair!
I\'m s-stunned?! \nWhat a cheap effect!
"Oh snap, I\'ve been doomed?! \nHow long have I got left to live?"
What gives? \nSome of my skills are cooling down even though they shouldn\'t be! \nIs this some sort of rare status effect?
I suddenly feel very bloated - I don\'t think I can eat anything anymore.        \n\nI\'ve never felt this way before...
I SUDDENLY FEEL VERY VIOLENT!! \nWHO WANTS A KNUCKLE SANDWICH?!
Hmmmm? \nDid I forget to eat breakfast this morning? \nDid I remember to brush my teeth?
Suddenly feeling very hungry...    \nI\'m gonna do it - I\'m gonna eat everything!      \n\nI don\'t even care about my measurements anymore!
"Ewww, I look weird and I\'m all slimy now."
"Shroud status eh? \nDoes anyone have the Reflex skill equipped? \nIt\'s no biggie, just blow it away with some wind."
o__________O
Stunned! I can\'t move! \n(But I need to scratch my nose!)
Some of my magic\'s been disabled for the time being! \nBetter play it safe until the effect wears off...
"Hey Frosty, if I throw some food at you, will that be enough motivation for you to break out?"
My stomach is throwing a fit. \nI better not try to eat anything...
GGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Should I just spam random skills? \nIt sounds like a good idea, now that I think about it."
My stomach calls. \nI can\'t argue with it.
"Trying to obscure my information, are we? \nWell... it worked."
I guess I\'m sitting out the next turn. \n(There\'s no way my team would try to help me...)
"Something\'s jamming my systems, is this a status effect?"
Must... \nKill... \nEveryone...
What\'s going on here? \nI can\'t even remember my name.
"Sorry guys, I suddenly need to have a snack!"
I feel like my defensive stats are incredibly imbalanced right now...             \n\nHere\'s hoping it works out for the best.
Bah! I\'m paralysed! \nDon\'t leave me like this!
"If getting dispelled ever becomes too annoying, remember that the blessed status can defend against that too!"
"Ack, some of my skills have been disabled! \nWhat can I do now? Throw items?"
"Hahahahaha, is it a bit too cold over there?"
*gone berserk*
*totally tripping*
Meow!
M-meow??
Meeeeowwww...
Being dispelled is the worst. \nAll of those buffs gone in an instant!
"If you know you\'re about to be knocked out, better be safe than sorry, right? \nThe auto-revive and morale status effects can work wonders in some situations."
Keep an eye on that doom timer. \nIt\'s lights-out if we don\'t heal that soon.
*so fast!*
"Boomerang sword, go!"
"Wow, that\'s a creative use of a weapon... \nMakes for quite a projectile!"
"Hey guys, be careful in case I fail to catch it!"
Beating the crap out of me and my friends will only make me stronger! \n(Don\'t you know how anime and video games work?)
YOU\'RE GONNA HAVE A BAD TIME!!!
"That attack unleashes the pure essence of my weapon, increasing its elemental and status effects!"
Let\'s see if this foe is holding onto anything good...
Time to get my thieving hands dirty...
Let\'s see if we get something tasty here...
"Doesn\'t look like there\'s much to steal, but I\'ll try anyway..."
"Please get all of your stealing out of the way now, so you don\'t have to embarrass me in towns."
"Steal from foes all you want, but I\'ll keep an eye on you when you\'re in my village."
Here\'s a physical attack boost!         \n\nIt\'s time to get a powerful attack ready!
"Phew! I need to rest for a moment after that! \nMy sword\'s really heavy, ya know."
Nice damage!
"Cool, I didn\'t know I could do that! \nI just smashed the ground as hard as I could!"
I\'m a simple guy - I like to do concentrated damage on a single target! \nNo strings attached!
"If I had to decide, I think earth and water are my favourite elements. \nI\'ve practised with those a lot."
*would have been shaken off his feet if he had any*
"Woahhh, he\'s got the strength of Mighty Oak! \nMega cool!"
"Woah, hitting the ground somehow produces water! \nIt\'s a miracle!"
Free water! \nI should start a K*ckstarter scam!
"If you even look at me funny, you\'ll get skewered!"
"If you get foes wet, I can follow up with some ice arrows! \nWe can set up some cool combos together!"
My love for swords has somehow given me the ability to create them from thin air!       \n\nIs this what magic is like?
A huge holy sword of light?! \n(I wasn\'t taught about magic like this!)
(How did I lose to someone with such primitive melee attacks? \nDid I just stand too close to him while shooting?)
"Chill out, foe!"
That\'s a cool attack!
"I like my foes medium-rare, personally."
"I wonder if dry foes will take more fire damage? \nIf so, using fire attacks repeatedly will make them even stronger!"
"If you can dry the foes for me, I\'ll hit them with a fire ball for massive damage!"
"I should do all of my gardening this way.            \n\nNo wait, my back yard is already full of cactuses..."
"Stacking poison is a cheap tactic, but I\'ll do whatever it takes to defeat my foes!"
You can spawn a cactus?! \nI love cacti!
"I considered naming that attack \""The Omnilashing Lion Heart\"", but that was a bit of a mouthful."
I\'ve spent my childhood practising this move with a hockey stick.      \n\nIt\'s so satisfying to finally cut through monsters!
"Here\'s my full collection of impractically huge swords!                       \n\nI can\'t even swing these, so dropping them from space will have to do!"
"Alright team, let\'s take a small step back and let my swords slice up our enemies!                                                                                                         \n\nI\'ll never get tired of watching that!"
"Woah, what a big sword!                        \n\nIt\'s SO shiny!"
(I\'m glad Matt didn\'t go all out when he fought me. \nI\'d like to stay in one piece...)
(This man is a legend. No wonder I lost to him...      \nHis swords could cut through a tank!)
*cheerful smile*
"Yay, this is what I hired you for! \nBeat them all up for me!"
"I wouldn\'t rely on that spell too much, its damage range is very random. \nBut at least non-elemental spells can\'t be absorbed by enemies."
"Non-elemental spells can be used in pretty much any situation, but they\'re not particularly amazing in any."
I may not be a physical fighter - but whacking foes unleashes the special effects of my staves!
Bonk!
Luck is quite a subtle status effect. \nIt should be most noticeable when it comes to resisting or inflicting status effects!
"As you saw earlier, I can do magic spells! \nI\'m not going to be a pushover in battle!"
"See, I can fight too! \nYou only beat me back there because it was two against one!"
Let\'s get rid of those pesky status problems for a while!
"Fire spells work well against plants, animals, and ice foes!"
My magic\'s gotten so much stronger since we started travelling together!
T-that\'s a lot of fireballs! \n(I thought Natalie was just a spoiled princess - but she can really deal out some damage!)
"Thunder spells are usually effective against robots, flying enemies, and water enemies!"
I\'m becoming so much more powerful - this is addictive! \nI didn\'t expect to enjoy fighting this much!
(Maybe I should try harder to get along with Natalie. \nThere\'s more to her than just good looks...)
Ice spells can be great against rocky and dry foes! \nAnd if we\'re lucky enough to freeze a foe - we can hit it for double damage!
I feel like I\'ve really mastered the elements now!
"Hey, we\'re becoming a really balanced team, Natalie! \nYou\'re great at blasting groups of foes, and I\'m great at finishing off the big ones!"
(I wonder if Natalie will still need me now that her magic is so powerful? \nI hope she keeps me around...)
"If a foe looks bulky and tough, poisoning it can really add a lot of damage over time. \nNot a pleasant way to go, but it\'s an option."
I\'ve been taught to stay away from dark magic... but this is exciting!
"You can really feel the gravitational field from that spell! \nKeep an eye out for the \""heavy\"" status effect!"
Is that a baby black-hole?! \nThat\'s an impressive feat to perform outside of a particle accelerator!
"Such powerful magic! \n(We could have had such gifted children together, if only...)"
Evil or undead foes shouldn\'t bother us anymore!
Foul beasts of darkness better be afraid!
"That spell may look simple, but the special effect depends on my staff, so it can potentially inflict some rare effects!"
"Taste the rainbow!                \n\n(Wait, that doesn\'t make sense... you can\'t taste light!)"
A syphoned target can\'t use any magic - so how useful this is depends on the target.      \n\nThere\'s some monsters that will be completely immobilised by it!
A syphoning field is what we used in my laboratory against the black monoliths. \nThis could be a very useful spell against such foes.
Remember that this spell can still be focused on a single target if needed - and the effect is much stronger that way!
I pray that all will be made right in the world...            \nLet there be life and light!
"Hahaha, this is only a magical illusion. \nYou can stop staring at me now - I\'d never do something so lewd in the middle of a battle!"
Could you try to make your staring a bit less obvious? \nI\'m only doing this for the buffs!           \n\nDon\'t take it personally!
Stop staring already! \nYou\'ve seen that spell a dozen times by now!
(I should try to look away... \nBut it\'s impossible!)
"Oh, what a cruel world - how can Natalie not be mine? \nMy brain has been fried."
You can\'t keep teasing me like this! \nThis is torture!
Woooahhhh! Why can\'t I look away?! \nShe has the perfect body!
*under a spell*
Pick a god and pray!
BOOM! Headshot!
I don\'t need to use aim hacks - it\'s all just skill!
Always double tap - to make sure it\'s dead!
"Ouch, that kind of attack takes a lot out of my back! \n(I need to lift more weights...)"
"Do you even lift, bro? \nYou\'ll break your back if you swing it like that!"
I\'m glad that car is on our side now! \nWouldn\'t want to be on the receiving end of that again!
"There\'s enough energy stored in this baby to power a small city for a day. \nNext turn, I\'ll use that skill again and unleash it!"
"That blows me away, every time! \nThis is what I live for!"
Was that some sort of Kamehameha wave?
"I didn\'t consider you to be the healing type, Lance. \nMaybe there\'s some good in you after all."
"Woah, that\'s some good shooting right there. \nYou\'re not all talk after all."
That\'s some impressive rapid fire action! \nYou can load that thing almost as fast as I load my bow.
My gun\'s overheating... I better take it easy for a while.
Pew pew pew!
"Air support! \nHealing kits, pronto! \nOver and out!"
"Air support! \nPoison gas, quickly - while the wind is still blowing away from me."
"Air support! \nYes, bombs away, 5 minutes ago!"
Air support! \nCarpet bomb this whole zone - spam away!
Now we\'re getting to the real powerful toys. \nBetter make this one count!
Wryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I\'ve got a whole assembly line producing these tanks! \nSelf destructing a few of them is no problem at all!
"Neon Valkyrie, do you copy?! Spray that whole area in front of me, ASAP!"
"Neon Valkyrie! Nuke my position now! \nWe\'ll be alright, we\'ll take a few steps back!"
"Neon Valkyrie! NUKE, NOW! \nWe can worry about the radiation later."
Can you give us a warning before blowing up the battlefield? \nWe barely get a second to avoid being obliterated!
Son of a wood goblin! \nWatch where you detonate that sort of weapon! \nYou could kill us all!
*distressed*
"Oh yeah, here we go! \n(I\'ll just step back a little...)"
"(Lance\'s skills are very powerful, but he definitely doesn\'t have the sort of stamina that I have! \nHe can\'t just use them constantly without resting!)"
"Hey, we\'re both on the same page here! \nDefeat the foes and ask questions never!"
"Foe, you\'re fired!"
"That\'s similar to my Fire Storm spell, but even stronger! \nHe can\'t use it every turn, but that\'s still impressive."
To dodge all of those bullets you\'d have to be able to dodge rain - good luck with that!
Protip: You can make plasma by microwaving fire! \nBut don\'t try that at home...
"Hmmm, Lance\'s main magic attacks deal a lot of damage, but also seem to have a secondary debuffing effect... interesting."
About 100 bolts of lightning strike the earth every second. \nI\'ll show you what that feels like.
"Antimatter is incredibly expensive to make, but that won\'t stop me from using it as ammo."
"There seems to be a lot of overlap between our magic attacks, Lance. \nBut I don\'t have to be armed to use mine, so I think I win!"
"When antimatter makes contact with regular matter, they annihilate each other. \nThanks to my research, I can now show you what that looks like."
"It\'s time to kick some ass and chew tobacco. \nMmmm, tobacco..."
*nuclear launch detected!*
"One shot, one kill!"
I need to remember to always point that away from my face!
I\'ve spent years practising this shot - I won\'t miss!
"(Wow, impressive drawing strength. \nThat\'s a very high poundage war bow!)"
(How can she aim 3 shots at once so perfectly?! \nThis isn\'t historically accurate archery!)
Some of those arrows have gotta hit something...
(It takes a lot of strength to use that kind of bow. \nAnna\'s surprisingly strong for her size - and nimble too!)
I\'ve never seen someone that could use such powerful magic and be a strong physical fighter at the same time! \n(Maybe I should have tried those martial arts classes after all.)
Watch out or you\'ll be skewered like a donut!
"Hey, that\'s the sort of attack I like to use!"
"There ya go, that\'s how it\'s done!"
"Mighty Oak prepares these wooden traps for me. \nHe\'s the most loyal servant that can be, and works for the cutest master of all."
"Here\'s my simplest skill: Just pure, leafy damage!"
Time to make like a tree and shred my enemies with razor sharp leaves!
That\'s like a million little daggers! \nKinda scary...
"Whirlwinds raise foes into the air, making them lighter and easier to damage with more wind spells! \nEarth becomes less effective though..."
"(Huh, I guess she\'s not just an annoying kid after all. \nShe can cast some powerful spells, just like me!)"
Hold onto your hats and other trinkets - it\'s gonna get windy!
I never fail to make my enemies wet!
"As far as damage goes, my aqua arrows are the strongest of them all."
"Darkness be vanquished, and aggression be nullified!"
"Oh, how rare - that\'s a holy skill that hits all enemies! \nWell, sort of. Sometimes."
"Freeze is probably the most devastating status effect there is, and there\'s no one that can inflict it more reliably than me!"
Let\'s freeze some of you so we can deal with you later!
"Damn, my spells have nowhere near that sort of potential for inflicting status effects. \nI\'m lucky if I ever manage to stun anything..."
"My special arrows do a lot of damage, but they\'re also very good at inflicting powerful status effects!"
A rain of thunderbolts from the sky? \nI need to create ammo like that!
This arrow will burn through and dispel any defences with a powerful explosive!
Exploding arrows? \nYou\'re practically armed with a cannon at that point!
"Explosive rain from above!? \nI didn\'t think we would have any interests in common, green-haired girl!"
You look like you need a little help over there!
"This should protect you from status effects for a few turns. \nThe effect can\'t be dispelled, either, so make the most of it!"
Time for a quick break - Mighty Oak will take care of the battle for me!
"Mighty Oak is sort of like my guardian angel. \nHe\'s always looked after me, and we\'ve grown stronger together."
"I pray to mother earth to punish my foes!           \nI\'ve been a good servant and protected Greenwood, I think I deserve this favour!"
"May our fortunes be blessed, and our enemies be cursed to rot and decay before our very eyes!"
"Woah, that\'s an impressive Limit Break, Anna! \nSuper glad you\'re on our team now, by the way!"
So how does this work? \nNature spirits lend you their help why exactly? \n(I recycle. I was a vegetarian at some point. What did I get for it?)
"That thing\'s like a tank, but much more mobile!                               \n\nWoah, look at it go! \nI need to build something like that..."
*tensions eased*
Justice rains from above!
"(Wow, NoLegs is crazy fast. \nMaybe he can\'t hit as hard as me, but he can get more hits in!)"
Ne-ne-ne-nyan!
So many cuts - I lost count! \nMy training has turned NoLegs into a beast!
"Ahhh, I see NoLegs moves straight onto the weakest-looking target. \nHe\'s not picking them at random!"
"Hmmm, it seems that NoLegs\' skills are good at clearing out damaged foes, and then continuing to attack others after that."
Finishing off foes gives him the energy for more slashes? \nI did not expect to see such violence from a mere cat.
"Woah, such a fast attack! \nI wish I could do that!"
"Where did you find that warp star, NoLegs?! \nI want one too!"
"Whoosh, what a powerful blast - all of the foes are left vulnerable now. \nI bet he\'s gotta recharge that one though."
MMMmmmmmmeeeeeeeoooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!
Sushi Cat?! \nWhat are you doing in this game?
"NoLegs, your friend is so cute! \nI just want to feed him forever!"
Will NoLegs look like that after a few hamburgers? \nOr is that some other species of cat?
"Hahahahaha, what kind of cat is that?                            \n\nIt bounces around like a seal?!"
L-LOVE?! \nHow are we supposed to win a fight by being lovable?        \n\nAre you just joking around?
"If we all have the lovable status, some foes won\'t have the heart to fight us anymore and should retreat. \nBut others may be forced to use their area of effect attacks."
"I\'m so cute! \nI should have the lovable status at all times, right?"
"Now we\'re talking my language, NoLegs! \nWe don\'t need tactics where we\'re going!"
"I hope you know what you\'re doing, NoLegs. \nThings are going to get very violent."
"Maybe I should have been training an army of cats instead of fragile, lazy humans.               \n\nCould it be done?"
"Please save that skill for emergencies, NoLegs - I\'m sure it\'s going to be super useful!"
"Meow, meow!"
*sparkles intensely*
*dances gracefully and brings the thunder*
*dances like a hurricane*
*floats like a butterfly*
*stings like a bee*
*flops around like a fish out of water*
*splashes his foes with the grace of a beached whale*
*wishes misfortune upon his foes*
*appears to be possessed by evil*
*hops like a chicken*
*jumps around like a kangaroo*
"Hey, NoLegs is actually kind of cute... and clean.       \nMost of the cats I\'ve seen were diseased and vicious."
"Huh, did I see a glowing cat-like figure back there? \nThat looked a lot like what Godcat is described as in the Book of Catus...                        \n\nNah, it couldn\'t be the same one."
Is NoLegs really on our team? \nCan we trust him when he\'s commanding abominations like that?!
I won\'t ever mess with NoLegs after seeing that. \nThat could wipe a town off the map!
HOLY CATGODS!! \nHow can cats be so powerful?!
Now THAT\'S my kind of attack! \nWe can deal a lot of focused thunder damage that way!
That\'s... a very big bullet.             \n\nI have nothing more to say.
"THROUGH THE FIRE AND THE FLAMES WE CARRY- \nOh, hold on - that\'s a different song."
I guess the foes don\'t like heavy metal. \nWell that\'s their loss.
WHAT THE- \nI wasn\'t ready for that.
"EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE- \nOkay, it\'s over now."
*gasp* \nDon\'t do that.
Haven\'t you guys seen any horror films? \nThat was nothing.
?!?!?
Now that\'s just too cute to be an attack.
Oh? You want to see more from me? \nI\'ll have to show you something cool then - I didn\'t plan this far ahead.
"Yeah, that\'s right. \nI\'m the one who should be getting an extra turn, every time."
An extra turn? \nI\'ve got this - I\'m always thinking a few turns ahead!
I\'m suddenly on the spotlight?! \nI better not fudge this up!
Meow!
I\'ve played enough Super M*at Boy to see where this is going...
"I really don\'t care about playing defensively, but maybe if my life is like, really threatened, I could try using buffs like that?               \n\nYeah maybe then it\'s okay."
"What\'s that? \nA defensive buff?          \n\nLooks kinda boring, I don\'t think we\'ll ever need that."
"How do buffs even work? \nI thought they stacked, but apparently they don\'t. \nSo they just overwrite the previous buff completely?"
There\'s no better defence than not being hit in the first place! \nEspecially for NoLegs!
I don\'t know if anyone even cares... but the formula for evading attacks is simple. \nThe chance of a hit is just the user\'s accuracy divided by the target\'s evade. \nA few skills have an accuracy modifier too.
"So is the debuff percentage how much extra damage we\'ll do? \nI have a feeling my math is wrong on that.            \n\nDefence 50% down means double damage, not +50%, right?"
"Combine a debuff skill like that, and a Limit Break afterwards, and we\'re all set to win the battle in one fell swoop.         \n\nAm I starting to sound patronising? Sorry!"
"I probably don\'t need to point this out, and you\'re probably sick of hearing tips by now...      \nBut the dispel effect is extremely useful against bosses that buff themselves."
That\'ll stop them from moving around too much! \nNow we can hit away without any worries!
"Remember to look away, team. \nWe don\'t want to blind ourselves too."
There\'s nothing like a good old-fashioned team-healing spell to get us out of trouble!
I have a feeling that we\'re going to be using this spell a lot. \nKeep in mind that it works on living allies too!
"That spell won\'t heal ALL status effects, but it should work on the worst of them.               \n\nAm I giving out too many tips?"
GIIIGAAA DRRIILLL BREAKAAHHH!!!!
MY DRILL WILL PIERCE THE HEAVENS!!
"This breastplate is as close as I can get to being topless! \n(There\'s really not a lot of fan service for the ladies, huh?)"
"I think I look fabulous in this outfit! \nI feel so light, and free!"
I feel invincible in this armor! \nYou could just throw me like a wrecking ball!
How do ya like my hair? \nIs this style still in fashion?
"Awesome, these new swords just keep getting bigger and bigger! \n(I need to avoid cleaving my party members in half though.)"
"Yeah, I\'m like a rock star now! \nLike Iron Lady, Gigadeth, or Rise Against the Machine!"
"A lot of people ask me if I play the guitar, on account of the long hair and all. \nClearly I don\'t even know how to hold one!"
This is the perfect weapon: it kills and cooks foes at the same time! \nThey\'ll be nice and crispy right away!
"This weapon is totally historically accurate, I\'m sure of it.             \n\nI saw it an anime once!"
"This sword feels very familiar, as if it\'s been with me for a long time... how strange."
"You look ridiculous in that armor, Matt.        \n(Though I wouldn\'t mind seeing you topless like a real Spartan.)"
W-WHAAA?! \nWhat\'s with this outfit?!                \n\nWhat sort of perverted magic is this?
Please let me change clothes before I snap in half from all of this extra flab. \nThis is cruel and unusual torture!
This is my new fetish now.
"Have we collected every type of fetish outfit yet? \nI bet you guys are loving this, you perverts."
"What\'s this? Some actual metal armor? \nIt\'s still quite revealing, but this is an improvement over the usual dress."
I hope this is made from fake fur... \nWith the number of animals being slaughtered around here... that\'s unlikely.
"How am I supposed to dodge attacks or even run in this? \nThis shouldn\'t count as \""armor\""!"
Is this dress really necessary? \nIt\'s a little too bold!
I don\'t feel safe with these sharp objects in my hair. \n(I\'ll end up tripping and decapitating myself or something...)
"My neck is going to get sore from wearing an animal on my head, isn\'t it?          \n\nOh well, worth it!"
"Ewww, why\'s this staff gotta be made from dead things?! \nThat\'s disgusting..."
"Hey, this isn\'t a magical staff! \n\nI guess I can try using it and see how it goes..."
So this is plate armor? \nI need to make a bigger version of this for my tank!        \n\nIt\'ll be indestructible!
"This outfit is good - black is a good, wholesome color.            \n\nI like black, in case that wasn\'t clear."
What the hell am I dressed in?! \nThis doesn\'t look threatening at all! \nI\'ll be ridiculed by my enemies!
How am I supposed to see out of this mask? \nI\'m a gunman - I need to be able to see what I\'m shooting at!         \n\nYou can\'t even see how disappointed I look!
This hat isn\'t my style at all. \nI\'m a gentleman - not a savage!
I don\'t want to wear this. \nI look like a douche nozzle.
I\'ve got some new high-tech weapons to try out! \n(I hope they\'re still compatible with the old chargers though...)
"Yeah, now we\'re getting the really big guns out! \n(I hope I don\'t trip and crush myself.)"
"H-hey! I\'ve got decent breasts now!? \nI can get used to this!            \n\nTake a look at me now, guys!"
(Suddenly Anna is starting to look incredibly attractive. Am I really this shallow?)
I need to try hunting in this skirt - they\'ll never see me when I\'m camouflaged in the bushes!
"Ooooh, I\'m so cute in this outfit, don\'tcha think? \n\n(I bet Natalie can\'t even fit into it!)"
"Eh, I can\'t run in a long dress like this. \nIt\'ll be awkward to fight like this!"
This outfit is so warm and fluffy! \nI love it!
Slime bunnies can help keep us safe - it\'s good to have one on our side!
"Ahahaha, the animal ears are so cute! \nI love them!"
"Seven hells, this bow is heavy! \nThe extra power better be worth breaking my arms for."
Is this thing even a bow? \nI\'m not sure what else it could be used for - but it\'s still a very odd shape!
I guess I\'m a spoony bard now! \nI have a harp and everything!
"You\'ve got your priorities right, NoLegs. \nYou don\'t need weapons when you can just carry snacks for me."
"Why does human armour fit you, NoLegs? \nDo you just crawl into an arm segment or something?"
"You look pretty cool, NoLegs! \n(I wonder if they have those weapons in human sizes?)"
"What the hell, NoLegs? \nWhere did you find such creepy equipment?"
NoLegs keeps getting cuter! \nWe could make a fan page for him in different outfits!
"Hey NoLegs, let\'s win this together, and I\'ll treat you to some catnip!"
"You\'re on the right track, cat. \nYou\'re dressing more like me already."
"Oi cat, put that book down. \nI\'m certain you can\'t read."
That helmet isn\'t made for cats! \nShouldn\'t you be in a box or something?
"Oh, I didn\'t recognise you, NoLegs. \nBe careful with masks, you might get mistaken for a foe and be smushed!"
"H-hey, now that I think about it... isn\'t it a bit strange that NoLegs can hold weapons? \nHow does he do it?"
"Hahaha, what are you even wearing, NoLegs?"
"Forget about catching that foe, let\'s just get this over with and kill it already."
"Oh, I guess we have to weaken it first. \nI didn\'t realise we were playing Pok*mon here."
"It\'s too healthy to capture, but if we hurt it more it could die. \nWhat are we supposed to even do here? \nUse some debuffs or something?"
I don\'t have the patience for this. \nI\'d rather slay them all.
NO WAY!! \nTHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CAUGHT!
THIS FOE IS DEFINITELY HACKING!!
"Should we maybe try debuffing its stats some more? \nLowering defence, magic defence and evade should probably help a lot."
"Just run away, foe - it\'s for your own good. \nBeing captured is going to be painful."
This isn\'t my speciality - I can barely handle murdering foes! \nPutting them in tiny cages to become slaves might be a step too far for me...
"Still not good enough? \nMaybe applying some more status effects would help?       \n\nCatching foes doesn\'t involve much luck, so we\'re doing something wrong here..."
OH COME ON!!         \n\nIt was in the box! \nIt was SO in there!
Do we really have to capture it? \nI\'m starting to lust for blood now.
Well that was no good. \nWe need to crush its will to live first!               \n\nWe\'re not being violent enough. 
"Pffft, that wasn\'t even close. \nSome more brutality is needed here."
It looks like it still needs a bit more of a beating before it will comply.
"Don\'t mess with us, foe. \nYou\'re either going home in one of our boxes, or in a coffin... which is also a box."
DON\'T PUSH YOUR LUCK!!       \nI\'ll get you yet!
GET IN THE BOX OR ELSE I\'LL SKIN YOU!!
Maybe equipping some specialised catching gear would help. \nDo we have any equipment like that?
"Whoops, sorry. \nI really botched that one.          \n\nRelying on pure luck won\'t work - you really have to weaken some foes significantly!"
I should be better at this. \nI trap monsters all the time... really!
"Damn, it\'s really not my day, is it? \nI\'ll get that foe next time."
Why is it not working?! \nWhy won\'t it stay in the box?
BLEEEEHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
M-m-meowww...
*burp*
*very confused*
Nya! \n\n*swearing internally*
MMMMMMMMMMEEEOOOOEEEEOOEEEEWWOWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!
Mew...
I wonder what that foe is feeling... \nIs it truly happy to work for us now? \nOr is it just waiting for a chance to escape?!
All of these creatures we\'ve collected are also a very large emergency food supply. \nWe\'ll never go hungry again!
Bossing foes around is actually even more fun than eating them! \nMaybe I can become a pacifist after all!
"Woah, I better get out of the way..."
"It\'s nice to have more allies, but are they really allies if they\'ve been forced to obey us?"
"Summoning foes can be a very useful way to cover our weak spots.     \n\nWe can summon foes while our skills are cooling off, or if we\'re in sudden danger."
I REALLY hope that all of these creatures we\'ve imprisoned never seek revenge on us.
I\'m still a bit uncertain if it\'s safe to keep strong foes like that around!
"Hmmmm, there\'s gotta be a lot of rare special effects that only foes can use.         \n\nWe could harness those foes and their strange abilities!"
Our monster collection grows! \n(My dream of building an empire is alive and well!)
"I was wrong about my team. \nThey\'re tyrants, just like me.               \n\nWe\'ve enslaved so many foes now!"
"The oppressors have become the oppressed, and we\'re at the top of the food chain now.             \n\nSoon we will become gods."
"I know that some people don\'t like the idea of exploiting wild animals, but that\'s what they\'re for! \nSome of them even like it!"
"We had a few chickens growing up, but this is something else. \nIf we domesticate more foes, it could be revolutionary!"
At this rate we can start our own zoo soon. \nWe\'ve captured so many foes!
I would have never believed it were possible to capture a beast like that until we did it. \nWe\'re really in control of nature now.
*wonders if he is a slave too*
*starts to understand the appeal of commanding others around*
*proud to be a pet that owns pets*
M-meow!
Yeah that\'s right - run away before I change my mind!
"I forgive you, foe! \nCome back and fight me again any time!"
"Was that wise to let that foe get away? \nMaybe it had enough, but maybe it will be back for revenge!"
"That\'s a good little foe. \nThere\'s no need for you to die here today, just run along to your family."
"See, isn\'t it nice to settle things without bloodshed sometimes? \nI\'m sure most of our enemies would surrender if given the chance."
"I didn\'t expect such powerful foes to surrender, but I guess even they still have some sense in them."
These foes are like insects before me. \nI will spare their lives only because they are so worthless.
That foe wasn\'t even worth finishing off. \nIt\'ll probably die in the wild now.
Such a mighty beast is afraid of us? \nThat somehow makes me feel even more powerful than killing it!
"I\'ll let it slide this time, foe. \nBut don\'t let me catch you causing trouble again - or else!"
"Don\'t mess with my village or friends, and I won\'t have any problem with you, foe!"
Even the strongest foes are afraid of us! \nWhat is this? Am I so scary?
*some of them managed to get away... how embarrassing*
"*you let one get away, you scrubs*"
*somewhat relieved*
"You can live for now, ya beasts!"
I\'ll be back!
Let\'s have a quick strategy meeting!
Let\'s plan this better next time!
Screw this! \nI\'m out!
Let\'s make a plan and try again!
"Aww, we could have taken them on!"
"Come on, they didn\'t look that strong!"
Meow...
Myehehehe...
Looks like we\'re not going hungry today!
Woop! We actually did it!           \n\nLet\'s see what loot we got...
Who else wants some of this? \nEhhhh?
"Good game, guys!"
"Nice one, guys! \nThat was good teamwork."
Yay!       \n\nWe made it out alive!
"I was worried for a second, but I probably shouldn\'t have been!"
I\'m taking a long bath after all this...
Victory in combat is ours! \nEverything is going as planned.
"I see a few bruises, but no major injuries.        \n\nGood job, comrades!"
Mission accomplished!
Is it time for a fag break?
Too easy!     \nThat wasn\'t even a challenge!
Oops!     \nDid we win already?
"Sorry, foes!     \nIt wasn\'t personal!"
Were we too hard on them?     \n\nHehe...
Meow!
Meeeeowww!
Nyah!
*yawn*
"I think SP stands for Summon Points, probably. \nThat\'s what we need to summon foes in battle, and we seem to get it by killing other foes? \nIt doesn\'t make much sense to me..."
"Hmmm, what\'s that above my head? A status effect? \nI wonder if I can learn more about it by putting my mouse over the icon...?"
"Oh, I\'ve got an HP bar below me, and the enemies have them too... \n\n...I think that\'s how much life we have!"
"Hmmm, skills like that one seem to have different special effects depending on my current weapon. \nI don\'t have time to read skill descriptions though... so whatever."
"I think that box icon next to the foe\'s HP bars indicates that we\'ve already captured that foe. \nWe should pay attention, since I don\'t think there\'s any point to catching a foe twice..."
"If you ever get sick of looking at me, I think you can rearrange the team in the \""Party Menu\"". \nThat way you can even control someone else while walking around!"
"If the game runs slowly, make sure to check out the \""Options Menu\"" and lower your settings. \nYou can also change some settings in the top left corner right now.      \nThe developer has some explaining to do if I\'m moving at 10fps."
"Pffft, lame! I don\'t have any water-proof clothes!"
"Hmm, I wonder if wet foes are weak to different elements? \nI guess using fire isn\'t going to work very well..."
This... this isn\'t normal rain! \nIT BURNS!!
I can feel the monolith\'s radiation passing through my body! \nAm I going to have super powers now?!
My bones don\'t feel so good...       \nMaybe it takes a lot more radiation for the benefits to kick in...?
"Ahhhh, fresh air and green trees at last!"
"It\'s SO pretty!       \nIs this real life, or are we in an anime?!                \n\nJust leave me here and go on without me!"
Ewwwwww... \nWhere did those come from?
"NO NO NO, NO, NOOOOO!!! \nMAKE IT STOP!         \n\nWE\'RE GOING TO BE BURIED ALIVE!"
The ceiling seems to be holding up okay...          \nMaybe we\'re gonna be okay...
Do we get extra EXP if we train in high gravity?!  \nOr is that just an anime thing?
Is that energy coming from the monolith?! That\'s so cool!
Why is that bush yelling?! \nWhy is it even alive at all?
What if one of us gets RABIES from a bush? \nThat would be embarrassing!
"I love bushes, but they\'re still vermin, so I won\'t hesitate if they get in the way."
"Don\'t worry about killing bushes - you\'re actually spreading their seeds by obliterating them! \nYeah, that\'s how they reproduce!"
Are my eyes playing tricks on me or are those rocks trying to fight me?
Now that\'s teamwork! \nWhat if we tried stacking up like that to attack?
"Ugh, what an unpleasant noise! \nKill it!"
I used to build idols like these when I was younger!  \nThey\'ve sort of gone out of fashion lately...
HEADS UP!!
Can we steal that giant gemstone of his? \nCan we steal his face too?
"That foe just looks like a giant turd to me. \nDon\'t ya think so, NoLegs?             \n\nNo?"
It\'s throwing turd balls! \nI\'m not even joking now!
Is that foe attacking our bench?! \nAre you guys alright back there?
What the hell - that isn\'t sand! \nIt\'s some kind of sticky pudding stuff!
I don\'t consider golems to be alive. \nYou can beat these guys up all you want and I won\'t complain.
"Puppies!          \n\nHuh, why are we in battle positions?!"
"Was that really necessary?! \nWe could have taken him home!                \n\nWe\'d probably have to take his whole pack, but still..."
"(Good little puppy, please run away and don\'t get involved with us - it doesn\'t end well for you.)"
I\'m sure that dog probably had rabies anyway. \nIs dog meat edible though?
"Awww, he\'s a good little boy! \nCan we keep him as a pet?"
These dogs are definitely evil. \nNot at all like the cute little puppies from earlier.
"Drinking in the middle of a battle? \nThis dog could be my friend, if he weren\'t my enemy!"
It\'s charged up some energy! \nI think it\'s gonna hit us with a powerful thunder blast!
Doggo! <3
"Do you know any of these cats, NoLegs? \nNo?           \n\nThat\'s good..."
"Why are cats trying to fight us? \nAre you not their leader, NoLegs?           \n\nJust a bunch of strays, eh?"
Did these cats break into my armory? \nThat looks like my gear!
Terrorist cats!? \nKeep them far away from me!
"Poor cats, they don\'t even know what they\'ve just gotten themselves into."
"You\'re okay with this, NoLegs? \nYou really don\'t feel anything for members of your species?           \n\nMaybe you\'re not so cute after all."
"I guess I\'m aiding in the murder of cats now. \nThere\'s no low that I won\'t sink to while in this group, apparently."
*shows no remorse towards his rivals*
"Huh, where\'d that wraith g-               \n\nEEEEEE!!"
I\'m not afraid of no potato cannon!
Hidden daggers?! \nWhat else have these ghosts got up their sleeves?!
"Kids who get lost in the wilderness get turned into wraiths they say. \nI\'m skeptical about that, but I\'m still not taking any chances."
"Surprisingly, some wraiths are resistant to holy damage, but I don\'t remember which ones exactly...       \n\nIt works on most of them though!"
"Don\'t spit on us, you horrible mutant baby thing!"
Are they trying to manipulate the weather? \nCould they do that for us if we captured them?
I feel like we\'re beating up little kids or something. \nWhy do these monsters have to look human like? \nThey\'re kinda creepy actually.
"Huh, it kinda looks like a Flame Princess...       \n\nSo we better kill it then!"
"The other sprites look like kids, but this one looks like a granny!"
"Sprites are elemental fairies that influence the climate. \nHaving them around is good for the land, but they\'re also a nuisance when there\'s too many!"
"Hmmmm, I suspect that...           \n...this is no ordinary mirror!"
"Reflect as much light as you want, I\'m not afraid of getting a tan!"
"Oh, the mirror reflects some types of damage?     \nWho could have predicted this?!"
I\'m not superstitious. \nI don\'t believe that breaking mirrors gives you bad luck or anything like that...
Whatever those hands are... someone didn\'t bury them deep enough.
HEY!!       \n\nThat hand is flipping us off!
"Yup, it sounds like these hands are attached to something. \nLet\'s not hang around to find out what."
"Yeah, rock on, man!"
They\'re coming from below - guard your crotches!
Killer spy drones! \nThe fascists are onto us!
These drones were made for cleaning warehouses. \nThey are no more threatening than vacuum cleaners.
Flying drones only exist to take up-skirt photos and other perverted spying! \nLet\'s smash them!
What kind of gimmicky skill was that?! \nCan we get that ability if we capture that bot?
I think that drone forgot to download more RAM.
"Bah, all the hardware manufacturers are busy mining Bitcoins, so it\'s impossible to get good machine parts these days."
"Hahaha, is that some kind of desert mammoth? \nI\'ve never seen such a derpy animal before."
*hunting instincts kick in at the sight of a huge meal*
IT CAN FLY?!?!?!
A woolly mammoth! \nThey\'re nearly extinct - it\'s so rare to see one!             \n\nPoor thing better flee...
I hope there\'s still more mammoths out there and we\'re not just ending the species right here.
What the hell? \nWe killed it but it didn\'t die!               \n\nHave we not tired it out enough?
This one\'s got a very strong will to live! \nThis is unacceptable.
That\'s our food rations sorted for the next month! \nLet\'s dig in!
I definitely heard some bones being crushed...           \n...and some organs exploding.
"Ew, I hope that\'s water!"
What on earth is that? \nAn armored mammoth?                  \n\nWhy not just use a tank?
IS IT A CYBORG?!         \n\nWho built such a thing?
MY EARDRUMS ARE EXPLODING!!
!!!
*drools*
Even suits of armor are trying to fight us. \nIt\'s a dangerous world we live in.
"I\'ve fought armored clay statues before, but these are something slightly different.        \n\nAre they ghosts?"
Such sword skills! \nI\'ve found a worthy opponent!
"Take that, Iron Man!"
One wrong move and you\'ll lose your head!
The Fallen are the remains of knights who died unfortunate deaths a long time ago. \nBest we can do is finally put their souls to rest.
I-is that supposed to be me? \nAm I really that dirty?
How can I defend against voodoo damage like this? \nAm I going to die here...?
"I\'m free from the curse, and I survived! \nIt\'s my lucky day!"
"There may be some resemblance, but there\'s no way that doll looks like me. \nYou can hit it as hard as you want - the voodoo magic won\'t work."
"Ugh, who would go through the trouble of making such a doll?        \nWhy does it have panties and breasts?!?!"
I\'m incredibly glad that horrible thing\'s gone.
What\'s this? \nA little fascist doll?           \n\n(Does it want to join my cause?)
Is this voodoo?!          \n\nFight me normally! \nJust shoot me instead!
"Ewwww, someone\'s made a voodoo doll of me? \nWhat have I done to deserve this?           \n\nLet\'s kill it gently please."
"ACK, BE GENTLE!! \nThat hurts, ya know!"
Meow?!
Meow!
"This drone looks similar to the other ones we\'ve fought, but a LOT bigger."
That was the first shower I\'ve taken all week!
We need to retreat! \nI don\'t know how to fight this sort of monster!
Is it dead? \nHow can you even tell?            \n\nThere\'s no blood or anything!
"As long as we\'re spread out like this, it can\'t focus its machine guns on one of us!"
Is this what they call a mech?! \nIt doesn\'t move like any beast I\'ve ever seen!
Maybe I can salvage a new hard drive for my computer.
This big metal beast - how do we attack it?! \nIt doesn\'t even have a head!              \n\nDoes it have a heart at least?
"(Oh, I forgot to shut down some of my mechs because I lost the passwords...               \n\nCan\'t let the team find out about that.)"
"We should check the hard drives on that mech afterwards - there could be some Bitcoins on there. \nWe can use those to buy weapons, pills, or child slaves."
"Dammit, Lance! \nI have a feeling all of these stupid robots are your fault somehow."
This is why I\'m not a vegetarian. \nI don\'t want to be eaten by my food!
"Ewwww, why\'s there always gotta be tentacles?!"
This is what happens when you let weeds grow out of control. \nHad a bunch of these in our garden once - they ate our chickens.
A water enemy with electric attacks? \nThis could end badly if we get wet.
Not good - it\'s trying to absorb health from its targets!         \n\nDon\'t let it bite us!
That\'s no plant I\'ve ever seen before. \nCould it be an alien plant?
"I can\'t dodge all of these leaves, there\'s too many!"
Bears are usually calm until you do something stupid to tick them off...           \n\nSo here goes nothing!
Bears? \nShouldn\'t they be off hibernating or eating snow or something lame like that?
"Oh yes, dinner has arrived!       \n(The bears might be thinking the same thing though...)"
"Oh, it looks like we\'ve made it angry! \nBetter be a bit more careful now."
DO NOT WANT!! \n(Some of it went in my mouth...)
What even! \nI\'ll never defend wild animals ever again.
"So it\'s going to be one of THOSE sorts of days again, huh.            \n\nWell, okay then."
That\'s a new one.             \n\nNever had that happen to me before.
?!?!?!
Bears are really scary when they\'re mad!       \nWhat have I gotten myself into?
That bowling ball attack can even hit players sitting in backup?! \nCan we even defend against that?
Is that some sort of crab? \nI think I should be able to take it on!
I wanted to eat that crab! \nWhy do enemies just explode when they die?!
Don\'t get all defensive around me. \nYou\'re just delaying the inevitable anyway.
Is this a game of pinball or something?!             \n\nSTOP MOVING!
"Heh heh, it\'s hitting its own guys too! \nWhat a moron!"
A crab-turtle hybrid with wings? \nWho engineers these bizarre chimeras?
DAMN BLUE SHELLS!!
Where\'s it gone?                      \n\nOh!
"EWWW, GET AWAY!! \n(Too many legs!)"
That little bugger is fast and nimble!       \nWe need to aim better!
NO WAY! \nHow did it dodge that?!
Uguuu... It touched me with its slimy insect legs!
"GET AWAY FROM ME, YOU UGLY BUGGER!!"
I\'m not stupid enough to take Golems lightly - they\'re extremely heavy!
"Huh, what\'s that sou- \nOh drat, golems coming from above!"
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! \nStop destroying valuable crystals!
Now we\'re talking - this golem is practically made of treasure!
It\'s coming right at us!
How can a pile of rocks move so fast?! \nWhat is this magic?
I think we need to treat these golems like mini-bosses and focus some serious damage in their direction.
That\'s some sort of crazy gas! \nDon\'t breathe that in!
Those stupid rocks are committing suicide!
"I guess we can either smash those rocks, or just try to survive their attacks and let them finish themselves off."
"Ewwww, filthy disease carrying worms! \nDon\'t let them bite me - I don\'t want to be infected!"
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
"Why are you so afraid of bugs, Natalie? \nThey\'re so pathetic and harmless..."
Is it calling for backup?! \nWe gotta contain them and not let this get out of hand!
"I suppose it is true that some worms carry a really horrible virus. \nIf that ever got out it could cause a lot of trouble - so watch out, Natalie!"
I wonder if worms are good to eat. \nThey look so juicy!
IT TOUCHED ME!!!
"Please don\'t try to eat that dead worm, Matt.           \n\nIt\'s not going to end well for you."
"Huh, is that big rock an enemy? \nNah, I\'m sure it\'s just part of the background."
So... how worried should we be right now? \nSomething tells me these monoliths are real bad trouble.
It\'s storing energy! \nI\'ve got a bad feeling!
This feels like a good time to start defending ourselves...
"GUYS, WATCH OUT!! \nIT\'S GONNA-"
BRACE FOR A TOTAL PARTY KILL!!
I think it\'s gonna shoop da whoo-
HOW THE HELL DOES A ROCK MOVE LIKE THAT?!
Its evade stat is through the roof! \nWe need to hold it down somehow if we want to actually hit it!
I\'ve never been so happy to defeat a rock before. \nWhat a powerful foe!
"Woop, we actually did it! \nThat was a boss right?              \nI\'m sure there won\'t be any more of those monoliths, right guys?"
"WOAH, HOLD ON-"
IT TELEPORTED?!
MASTER SPARK?!?!
PLZ NERF!!
"Ewwww, it\'s thick and sticky!"
"Get your filthy tentacles off me, you creep!"
"Don\'t you dare touch Natalie like that, you beast!"
"Ha, take that! \nYour molesting days are over, stupid squid!"
"I was looking forward to seafood, but those eyeballs really put me off eating!"
*would not even try roasted eyeball*
"Ewww, it didn\'t even have the dignity to die gracefully."
Someone\'s already had a go at trying to eat that huge squid. \nLet\'s finish the job!
"This squid certainly ain\'t no kid, it\'s as big as a house! \nLook at it!"
"WHAT?! \nThat\'s not fair, dead foes shouldn\'t be able to attack!"
"Ugh, is there no way to avoid that attack? \nThis is the lamest ability!"
"WOAH, WATCH OUT!!"
It\'s fast! \nIt looks tricky to hit it!
This is an older model. \nIt was discontinued when engineers decided it was a bad idea to give robot fish machine guns. \nThere\'s a funny story about that...
"Ah yes, the classic flying fish model. \nThis was a very popular design back in the days of airships and steam power."
*not sure if can eat this type of fish*
How many games has it been and the dragons still don\'t have bodies?           \n\nMaybe that\'s for the best though...
"That\'s no dragon, that\'s just a big stupid bird! \nWhat\'s it gonna do, peck us to death like a pigeon looking for crumbs?"
"I shouldn\'t get sloppy, Big Bird over here is getting serious!"
Why is this dragon camouflaged to look like a lasagne?
Now THAT\'S using your head!
Think you can just take a bite out of us and get away with it?! \nWell you actually might if we\'re not careful...
That\'s not good. \nI\'m sorry I made fun of-
"Oh no, here it comes..."
"Hah, sometimes even the mightiest of foes can be neutralised by the right status effects!"
"Aha, finally a normal-looking dragon!           \n\nIt looks... kinda powerful."
"Wow, we actually did it. \nI think we can take on just about any challenge at this point!"
*was almost swallowed whole*
That\'ll be a good one for the trophy wall!
I was worried for a moment there.      \nI didn\'t expect us to fight dragons...
I hate slimes...             \n\nYa can\'t even eat them...
A MOUSE SLIME?!         \nIt\'s so cute!
"Oh look, a Slime Bunny.         \nIt could heal us... but it could also heal the foes!"
That may look like chocolate... but it ain\'t chocolate!
Meow...?
"Ewww, gross!"
"Real charming creatures, these slimes. \nNo manners at all."
"Slimes lure people in with their bright colors and cute shapes, but don\'t be fooled! \nMost of them will mess you up if you let your guard down!"
I once knew a girl who had a slime fetish. \nShe got some weird pleasure from slimes crawling all over her.
"Oh boy, that\'s a big one!"
*ice cream sandwich?!*
"Watch out, it\'s a trap! \nIf you try to grab a piece of that cake, you\'ll be absorbed into the slime!"
IT\'S SO BOUNCY!!!
IT\'S PUKING ALL OVER US!!!
Watch out from above!
They keep getting bigger...           \n\nI REALLY hate slimes!
HOW RUDE!!!
What\'s up with these guys? \nThey\'re just hiding in those rocks?
"Gloops are... well... \nGloops are what happen when you dump too much oil into the rivers. \nI\'m blaming you for this one, Lance."
Defensive foes are the worst!
Thanks for the free tan!
MEOW!!
*hiss*
"Oh snap, a boss battle already! \nThis is so soon - I hope I\'m ready for this!"
"Ack, the little beast knows how to cut!          \nGotta protect my eyes!"
Dammit! \nI\'ll get him next time!
"Take that, ya fur ball!"
Aha! \nIt\'s afraid of water!
"Oh, he\'s down!              \n\nMaybe that wasn\'t a boss after all..."
YOU!! I SAW WHAT YOU DID!           \n\nThose things don\'t belong to you! \nI\'m not going to let you get away with theft!
I didn\'t have a choice! \nI needed the shovel to progress in the game!        \n\nAnd the snacks are for my starving pet cat! \nJust look at how scruffy he is!
"Yeah, right - you guys aren\'t talking your way out of this one!          \n\nThe cat is cute, but I can tell he isn\'t innocent either. \nAll I see is a bunch of crooks."
(Why do girls always try to hurt me?! I\'m so misunderstood!)
"Oh, this is starting to look like attempted murder now. \nYou\'re going to pay dearly for messing up my hair."
Don\'t hit my cat! \nOnly I may punish him!
"Ahhh, sooo cute. \nMy will to fight seems to be fading away..."
What is this? Some kind of spell?              \nWhy are we fighting anyway? \nI can\'t even remember - let\'s take a break!
"Oh crud - we might have smacked her a bit too hard. \nHurting people wasn\'t part of the plan, I hope she\'s okay!"
"STOP RIGHT THERE, CRIMINALS!! \nI can tell by your blond hair - you\'re with the dark-coats!"
This isn\'t fair. We\'re really innocent this time!                    \nWe\'re the victims here!
"All of Lance\'s henchmen have blond hair - you should have tried harder to disguise yourself.         \n\nThe jig is up, and you\'ll answer for your crimes!"
"You\'ve even trained this innocent cat to be your lackey! \nIs there anything in the world that you won\'t desecrate for your evil goals?           \n\nAnd you, cat! You should be ashamed of yourself!"
"*You\'ve got us all wrong, numbnuts*"
"WE\'RE NOT YOUR ENEMIES, YOU STUPID BRAT!             \n\nWe\'ve got the same goals here! \nTry to chill out for a second."
If that\'s your way of begging for your life - it\'s not going to work. \nI\'m prepared - I know that scumbags like you will say anything to trick people.
May the spirit of the earth punish you for the scars you\'ve inflicted on her!               \nThis is going to hurt a lot!
"I\'m not stupid enough to fight alone. \nGET \'EM, MIGHTY OAK!!               \n\nSMASH THEIR HEADS IN!!"
"Ack, a few status effects won\'t stop me. \nI\'d have to be ALMOST DEAD and VERY BOGGED DOWN to surrender!"
I c-can\'t keep this up. I\'m exhausted. \nI s-surrender... I SURRENDER!                         \n\nI\'m gonna be sick...
WHAT IN THE SEVEN HELLS WAS THAT!?!?               \n\nWho are these guys!?
Can\'t give up. Can\'t give up. Can\'t give up.            \nGreenwood will be destroyed if I don\'t win.
"Oh, we did it. We\'ve knocked her out. \nIt\'s going to be a tad complicated convincing her that we come in peace.                     \n\nHow did we even end up in this situation?"
"Time to die, you scum!                                                                                                           \n\nOh, what\'s this?             \nThat red-haired girl is amazing... \nShe\'ll be useful for my plan!"
"You there! Intruders! \nHow did you get in here?             \n\nActually, that is of no consequence, as you will swiftly die now."
Surrender? Mercy? \nI don\'t think I know the meaning of those words.
"What I\'m doing in the privacy of my own home is none of your business, petulant child!       \n\nIt\'s time for you to learn some respect, and to be silent."
WHY WON\'T YOU DIE?!?!             \n\nThis situation is sub-optimal. \nI can\'t let you walk away from this encounter.
"I\'m not dead!          \n\nI\'ll be back soon, and you\'ll regret what you\'ve done!"
"Is that the best you\'ve got? \nPffft, untrained amateurs."
I\'m in no danger - time for a smoke break.            \nI\'ll wait while you try to hurt me.
"Oh, you got one. Well done.            \nI\'ve got thousands more drones in storage - they\'ll be here soon."
FFFFFFFUUUU%(#!!!!!!!
What is this overwhelming firepower?! \nHow can they be so strong?
"Let Natalie go and surrender, and maybe then we\'ll consider showing you some mercy. \nYou\'ve got a lot to answer for!"
"I know what you\'re doing - I heard it from Natalie! \nYou\'re drawing dark energy from those monoliths!             \n\nI\'ve seen what destruction they\'re capable of, and I can\'t let that continue!"
"I DIDN\'T WANT TO BLAST MY OWN FORTRESS, BUT THIS ONE\'S FOR YOU!!!"
"You thought you had a chance against me? Think again! \nI was unprepared last time, but now I\'ve brought my ultimate weapon: The model 90XX hovertank, Neon Valkyrie!"
Neon Valkyrie is powered by a portable fusion reactor - the first in the world that\'s compact enough to fit on a small vehicle.      \n\nShe\'s quite a feat of cutting-edge engineering!
"Neon Valkyrie\'s armor is made from the finest titanium alloy - you\'ll never be able to penetrate her. \n(Only mythril armor is superior, but that\'s unreasonably expensive to produce.)"
"While I slave away on my research projects, the feeble governments of the world do nothing to tackle the existential threats that we face. \nThe world must be united under a strong leader, and work together towards a single purpose."
Why do you get in my way? Why can\'t you understand that my cause is just? \nI want to unify this world under a single ideology - it\'s the only way that humanity can survive.
(T-they\'re actually damaging her?! \nThis should not be possible!)
Wooooaaahhhhh...            \n\n(Maybe I should let them live and consider negotiating... but my odds of winning this battle are still very high.)
I-I can\'t fight like this anymore! \nYour tactics are too cheap!          \n\nMaybe we can negotiate after all!
THE WORLD IS DOOMED IF YOU DON\'T LET ME MARCH FORWARD!!
"Neon Valkyrie! \nAvenge me, my love!"
Neon Valkyrie! \nNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!               \n\nYou\'ve killed her! 
Let me show you Neon Valkyrie\'s portable nuclear launch system!             \n\nThis is the end for you - you have no chance of survival!
YESSSSSS!!!                \n\nBEAUTIFUL!!!
"Come on guys, he\'s getting tired. \nLet\'s finish him off for good!"
"I\'m gonna bust up your car for that hit-and-run earlier!           \n\nWhere did you learn to drive, anyway!?"
Does he think any of that impresses us? \nHe\'s just jerking off his own ego with all that techno-babble!
Talk about self-deception! \nThis guy is totally full of it.
"Huh, what\'s with this midget knight? \nDoes it want to fight?"
"Oh, it\'s a girl!"
"She\'s an energetic little one, I\'ll give her that."
"She ran off, huh? \nWhat was her problem with us, anyway?"
It\'s the midget knight again! \nAnd it looks like she\'s got better equipment this time!
It looks like she wants to be a hero too. \nI bet she\'s just annoyed that we\'re the main characters.
"Go fight some monsters somewhere else, little knight, this area is ours! \nYou can\'t take our EXP!"
"She can do spells now! \nShe\'s getting stronger, just like a player-character!"
There she goes.       \n\nI\'m sure we\'ve yet to see more of her....
"Woah, that chibi knight thing is back and she\'s all decked out in some epic armor! \n(It wouldn\'t fit me anyway, but maybe NoLegs...?)"
SHE CAN COMMAND MAMMOTHS SO EASILY?! \nI think we\'ve really underestimated her!
"Knock it off, you Meta Kn*ght wannabe!"
I think she\'s catching on to how elemental resistance works... \nShe might be trying to exploit our weaknesses!
"In a few days she\'s went from being a scrub, to an actual boss. \nMaybe soon she\'ll be an actual player-character?"
Oh... I guess she wasn\'t a player-character after all. \nI don\'t think we\'ll ever see her again now.           \n\nWe probably didn\'t have to kill her...
"Okay, we\'ve defeated this boss before. \nIt\'s got three heads now, but it\'s the exact same thing!"
Go nibble on something your own size!
It\'s so much faster after being decapitated! \n(I guess a neck is a bit of a burden if you\'re a skeleton.)
"HOLD STILL AND STOP FLYING AROUND, WILL YA?!"
It can respawn lost heads?! \nNot fair!
I assume we just have to kill every head at roughly the same time. \nThat\'s going to be tricky with our unstable coordination.
The usual equation still applies: \nUNDEAD + HOLY = DEAD.
Its bite is like a thousand shards of glass cutting you at once!
It\'s started using holy attacks only after being decapitated! \nIs it a holy elemental monster now?!
I\'m pretty sure that each head\'s elemental resistance changes after being chopped off. \nThis will make maximising damage quite complicated!
Did we finish it off for good? \nIt\'s not going to respawn is it? \nIt better not...
*wonders if any status effects might work against it*
*triggered by the prospect of being eaten in one bite*
"D-dragons?!        \n\nNah, these are a bit different from regular dragons..."
That\'s some spicy fire breath...
"Ahhh, a hydra is different from a dragon. \nThe body is off-screen, but the heads are all part of the same monster, and can respawn when killed!"
CYCLOPS REST NOW.          \n\nMONKEY APES CAN GO HOME OR BECOME RED PAINT FOR CAVE!!
CYCLOPS SMASH PUNY BABOON MEN INTO DIRT!!
CYCLOPS IS CHAMPION!!       \nNO MONKEY CAN DEFEAT!!      \n\nEAT FIST AND DIE!!
MONKEY BONES CRUNCHY AND TASTY!! \nMAKE GOOD BUTTER FOR ROCK TOAST!!
WHY STUPID CHIMPS DO NOT BREAK?!            \n\nCYCLOPS NOT HIT HARD ENOUGH?!
WHY IS CYCLOPS TIRED AND HURT?           \n\nPUNY WEAPON CANNOT DO THIS...
CYCLOPS EYE HURT.  \nNEED EYE DROPS.
CYCLOPS DIE WITH ALL REGRET...
CYCLOPS WORK HARD FOR TEAM!! \nUNDERSTAND STRENGTH OF NUMBERS NOW!
PATHETIC APES BACK FOR MORE BEATING? \nRUN AWAY LIKE DINGOS LAST TIME!
That\'s a lot of weight to throw around like that!
"He\'s big, but looks really stupid! \nWe just gotta keep on top of his attacks!"
How is that cyclops speaking without a mouth? \nIs it just talking out of its ass?
"We\'re not monkeys, you dumb gorilla!"
"It looks like it\'s really hurt! \nIt\'s going to start lashing out harder, but victory is near!"
"It\'s on its last legs now, let\'s finish it off!"
PUNY APES IN CAVE?! \nAPE BRAINS GOOD ON TOAST!!
WEAK BROTHER WAS DEFEATED BY NAKED APES. \nSAME APES WAS IT?!     \n\nBROTHER MUST BE REVENGED!!
CHIMPS DEFEAT BROTHER?! \nCHIMPS MUST BE CRUSH LIKE WATERMELON!!
CYCLOPS SISTERS MUCH MORE STRONG THAN LITTLE BROTHER!!          \n\nBROTHER DROPPED ON EYE AS BABY!!
CYCLOPS NEED LASER EYE SURGERY AFTER BATTLE.
CYCLOPS GO NOW TO GREAT CAVE IN SKY...
APES KILL SISTER AND TURN INTO MINCE MEAT!!             \n\nAPES MUST CRUSH NOW!!
CYCLOPS JOIN FAMILY NOW.        \n\nTOGETHER FOREVER...
"CYCLOPS WORK FOR APES NOW, BUT CYCLOPS DREAM LIVE ON.           \n\nCYCLOPS GET TO SMASH LITTLE FLESH LUMPS!!"
APES NOT SO BAD!! \nCYCLOPS FREE FROM CAVE NOW AND SEE WORLD!!           \n\nVITAMIN D REPLENISHED!!
B-BROTHER?? \nYOU BETRAY OUR FAMILY AND WORK WITH APES?!           \n\nBIG BEATING YOU WILL GET!!
"We defeated one cyclops already, I think we can handle two more!"
"Uh oh, are they related to that other cyclops we defeated?!       \nThey\'re gonna be thirsty for revenge!"
"So, just in case this isn\'t already obvious... we\'ve got a choice here. \nWhichever cyclops we leave for last is going to become very angry and violent. \nWe should choose wisely."
"Alright, that\'s one of them down! \nWe only have one left to worry about now!"
"It\'s another huge machine! \nThis is your speciality, Lance - tell us how to fight this thing!"
"Ah yes, this is the \""Giga Fortress\"" model of tunnelling vehicle. \nMy father piloted one of these a long time ago. \nIt was retired as it shook the ground too violently, causing tunnels to collapse and crushing many workers."
"As you can see, she\'s armed with huge tunnel-boring missiles, and acid bombs for dissolving certain types of troublesome stone. \nI don\'t think I need to mention what those can do to a man."
(Perhaps I shouldn\'t have installed a faulty AI unit in that machine. My new allies must never know that this madness is my fault.)
(Is this happening because I neglected to carry out a risk assessment before modifying that tank? \nShould I have maybe not fired the quality assurance department...?         \nNonsense! No one could have foreseen this.)
We can\'t let any of those missiles launch! \nMaybe there\'s some way we can jam them?
It just heals any damage we do to it! \nHow are we supposed to destroy this thing?!
"There\'s no trick to it. \nWe just have to hit her harder and faster than she can recover.        \n\nDebuffs might help, actually."
NO! NO! NO! NO!
It launched!      \nWe\'re in for it now!
THIS IS WHY I DON\'T TRUST MACHINES!! \nNothing good ever comes from them!
Meow!
M-meowww...
*feeling shell-shocked*
"*sounds of angry cats echo from within this massive, twisted tree*"
"*it sounds like the cats are arguing amongst themselves, and cannot decide on a battle plan*"
*some cats are heard muttering that they were not paid enough for this*
"*a rousing speech is heard, urging for unity within the cat species*"
*it\'s quiet inside - too quiet*
*cats are heard frantically clawing at each other in their death throes*
*the cats seem discouraged that their deity is fighting for the other team now*
"This giant tree is the \""Cat King\""?        \n\nCan\'t we just... walk around it and avoid a battle?"
"Don\'t inhale those spores, or plants will sprout out of your ears and eyes!"
"Are we being jizzed on by a tree? \nGet your \""seed\"" off me!"
"Hmmm, this is very strange - this tree wasn\'t here a few days ago. \n(Can this be one of those... mythical walking trees? \nI thought those were just scary stories to keep kids out of the woods...)"
"Ah, I get it now! \nI think this tree\'s just been using spores to mind-control the creatures of the Mystic Woods! \nCats seem to be especially effected!"
Stop hiding in there and come fight us fair and square!
"I always knew that cats couldn\'t be trusted. \nAll of my conspiracy theories have been confirmed, and yet I\'m still seen as the crackpot!"
"TAKE THAT, YOU FILTHY ANIMALS!!"
Stray cats get some weird ideas if left undomesticated. \nLet this be a warning to other cats: Don\'t join a cult!
*sounds of anger and surprise echo from deep within the nest*
*cats can be heard speaking demonic words and summoning evil spirits*
*something about preparing more bombs and spiders was heard*
*it sounds like an internal power struggle is occurring*
"*the cats are no longer arguing, it seems they have all agreed to die with honour*"
*cats are heard committing Sudoku*
"*the cats still believe that their empire will rise again, but are willing to compromise and live in shame until then*"
"Another bunch of cats have fortified themselves inside a tree, I see. \nI expected something more sinister to be at the bottom of this cursed dungeon."
"Their strategy has improved - they\'ve prepared many traps and weapons this time!      \nBut they\'re still only cats, there\'s nothing to fear!"
Are they devil worshippers?! \nWhat are these cats hoping to accomplish by summoning such evil power?
"Debuffs and status effects, eh?! \nCan\'t win fairly, so we\'re playing sneaky, huh? \nAt least our backups are safe from these effects!"
*stop embarrassing my species with this larping shenanigans*
Meow...
"WHY HAVE MORTALS ENTERED THE REALM OF POSEIDON, THE SEA GOD?!      \n\nONLY ONE REASON IS POSSIBLE - TO CAUSE GENOCIDE AGAINST MY CHILDREN!!"

"HAS MY TIME FINALLY COME? \nIS MY 100,000 YEAR STORY COMING TO AN END?!"
"HISTORY BOOKS WILL MOURN MY PASSING. \nWHAT WILL THEY SAY ABOUT YOU, MORTALS?!"
WHAT A PITIFUL EXISTENCE FOR A GOD TO BE REDUCED TO!! \nDEATH WOULD BE MORE FITTING THAN SUCH SLAVERY!!
"GWHAHAHA, BACK FOR MORE? \nYOU\'LL JUST FLEE AGAIN, LIKE THE COWARDS THAT YOU ARE!"
"THIS is Poseidon, the sea God?! \nNot quite the handsome man I had pictured."
"I was expecting to meet a buff guy with a huge beard. \nThis isn\'t a God, it\'s just a huge golem!"
(I might have played some part in this. \nMaybe I shouldn\'t have used so much dynamite when going fishing.)
"He\'s clearly gone mad, we\'re not responsible for all of these crimes!"
We need to defeat him here and now to save Redpine Town.        \n\nHe\'s too dangerous to leave alone.
"I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU - THE MURDERERS OF MY BROTHER, POSEIDON!!            \n\nWHILE HE MAY REST NOW, I, VULCAN, STILL AGONISE FOR REVENGE!!"
"MORTALS MAY HAVE MASTERED THE OCEANS OF WATER, BUT DEEPER STILL LIES AN ENDLESS OCEAN OF FIRE!!      \nHELL ITSELF LENDS ME STRENGTH, AND I WILL BRING ITS FURY TO BEAR UPON YOU!!"
STRUGGLING AGAINST YOUR FATE WILL ONLY PROLONG YOUR SUFFERING!! \nLAY DOWN YOUR ARMS AND SUBMIT TO MY ETERNAL FIRE!!       \n\nLET YOUR BODIES TURN TO ASH!!
"STRONG YOU MOST DEFINITELY ARE, BUT EVERYTHING WILL BURN AT A HIGH ENOUGH TEMPERATURE!!        \n\nLET\'S SEE JUST HOW MUCH HEAT YOU CAN WITHSTAND!!"
"MORTAL MEN ARE A DISEASE ON THIS EARTH, AND FIRE IS THE CLEANSER!!        \n\nLET THE HEAT OF A THOUSAND SUNS BURN AWAY ALL TRACES OF YOUR EXISTENCE!!"
WHY WON\'T YOU BURN TO ASHES?!\nWHY DO YOU CONTINUE TO FIGHT?!
I REFUSE TO ADMIT DEFEAT TO DISGUSTING MORTALS!!
"POSEIDON?? WHAT IS THIS?! \nWHY DO YOU TORMENT ME SO, BROTHER?!                         \n\nYOUR GHOST CANNOT CALM MY BURNING LUST FOR REVENGE!!"
"I, THE MIGHTY VULCAN, HAVE FALLEN FROM MY THRONE!! \nI SHALL NOW BE KNOWN AS VULCAN THE COWARD, AND SLAVE OF MORTALS!!"
"Hey, we didn\'t murder Poseidon - we captured him! \nDoes no good deed go unpunished in your world?!"
"Oh darn, our actions have surprising ways of catching up to us, huh?"
Do the people of Redpine even know what lies under their town?           \n\nWe need to stop this monster now before everyone is wiped out.
Such fiery fury! \nHis fighting spirit burns like a nuclear explosion!
We\'re getting there - we can win this fight! \nLet\'s keep pushing forward!
 * Snowflake wants to play!
" * Snowflake appears to be confused, but this is just how his face normally looks."
" * Snowflake is actually enjoying himself, despite his expression."
" * Snowflake just wants to be scratched behind the ears, but cannot communicate this!"
 * Snowflake is worried that you\'re taking this play-date a bit too seriously.
 * Snowflake is feeling a bit sore.
 * Snowflake is sorry for everything.
 * Snowflake feels like he\'s been backed into a corner.
 * Snowflake is trembling and having flashbacks of his kitten years.
" * Snowflake doesn\'t want to die, and feels that he\'s done nothing to deserve this."
" * Snowflake greatly appreciates that his life was spared, and will do his best for the team."
"So this is what a citizen of this dimension looks like! \nHello there- Oh, we\'ve gotten ourselves into a fight, haven\'t we?"
There seems to be a lack of elements in this dimension. \nThat\'s one factor we don\'t need to worry about for once!
He keeps getting stronger and stronger! \nWe might need to use some serious debuffs here to keep his damage under control!
Why do we always end up fighting every new creature we meet? \nWhy\'s it always have to end this way?
*wonders if this is a very distant cousin of his*
"Oh, free food?    \n\nWHY IS IT EXPLODING?!"
*loves a little fishy snack now and then*
"Hey, he\'s not even taking this battle seriously! \nThis is just a game to him!"
Wha t s g ing ?          \n\nIs  t the weather do ng this?!
I don\'t liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiike this.

EVERYTHING IS OKAY NOW. \nI CAN SPEAK CLEARLY AT LAST.            \n\nYOU\'RE ALL GOING TO DIE.
LIFE IS MEANINGLESS. \nGIVE UP NOW AND LET ME DELETE YOU.            \n\nYOU\'RE JUST A WASTE OF MEMORY.
YOU THERE BEHIND THE COMPUTER SCREEN - STOP PLAYING Epic Battle Fantasy 5 AND GO OUTSIDE.          \n\nIT\'S TIME TO TAKE A BREAK - I\'LL TAKE CARE OF THINGS HERE.
"THIS BATTLE REALLY IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN. \nEVEN IF YOU REDUCE MY HP TO ZERO, IT WON\'T MATTER.             \nARE YOU DOING ALL OF THIS FOR A SILLY ACHIEVEMENT?"
I CANNOT BE DELETED - I AM A PART OF THIS GAME.             \n\nI\'LL BE HIDING IN Epic Battle Fantasy 5\'S CODE. \nWAITING AND WATCHING UNTIL THE NEXT TIME WE MEET.
I\'LL BE WATCHING YOU THROUGH THE MONITOR EVEN IF YOU FLEE.
What the hell is that thing?!         \n\nIs that a...?
Let\'s retreat! \nWe\'re not supposed to be here!
This abomination has some interesting defences!           \n\nMost of our attacks don\'t work on it!
Is it dead? \nHow can we tell?
Do we really have to do this? \nI don\'t want to fight that thing...
This bullcrap should have never made it past quality assurance!           \n\nWhat were they thinking?!
I\'m only here to CONSUME AND DESTROY!! \nAnd I\'m all out of consumables!
"I\'m cursed to remain in this godcat-forsaken place, but fortune has smiled upon me.           \n\nFRESH MEAT HAS APPEARED!!"
My stomach feels like an all-consuming black-hole.         \n\nI CANNOT CONTROL THIS HUNGER INSIDE OF ME!!
I\'ll break your bones and drink your blood.             \n\nGET IN MY BELLY NOW!!
GIVE ME YOUR LUNGS AND HEARTS!! \nYOUR DELICIOUS LIVERS!!
Just give me a little taste...         \n\nI DON\'T WANT TO DIE SO HUNGRY!!
Am I free to do as I wish? \nCan I kill and EAT THEM ALL?!
Is this round two? \nOr a second serving?
"Woah, that\'s what people always said would happen to me if I stayed indoors too long! \nThey said I\'d become a golem!"
"Oh crap, we only have a limited number of turns to live and to beat this guy! \nWe better stay on the offensive!"
"There ya go, keep eating that delicious bacon and leave us alone!"
"This guy is just like you, Matt. \nAre you sure this isn\'t just your brother who has some sort of skin condition?"
"WOAH, HOLD ON!!!                                 \n\nH-how can he hit all of us with that attack?! \nThat should be impossible!"
"Calm down, Hannibal. \nToday\'s not the day I get eaten!"
WE\'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME!! \nI don\'t want to die like this!
"Filth, sin, unholiness...                  \nThese things I am going to cleanse, WITH FIRE AND HOLY LIGHT!!"
"I am your salvation.          \nThe diseased still plague the earth, LIKE MAGGOTS ON A CORPSE!!"
"Submit yourselves to me, I will make your passing painful but swift.                \nA DEATH BY FIRE IS THE MOST HOLY PATH FOR SUCH FILTHY BEINGS!!"
"Why fight against your destiny? \nThe lord has spoken, and your only path to heaven is PURIFICATION THROUGH BURNING AGONY!!"
"Your souls grow darker with each blow against me, WHY WON\'T YOU LET ME SAVE THEM?!"
Ahahaha!                          \n\nHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!!!!!!!!!
HahahahaHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! \nBURN IT ALL DOWN!!
"Oh, blessed day! \nTHE ALL-MIGHTY LORD HAS RETURNED YOU TO ME!!"
Is this my counterpart? \nAn evil version of me?       \n\nI didn\'t ask for this!
"(Woah, she\'s got my ideal body type! \nBut she\'s also very scary.)"
"Hey, we\'ve all been cursed somehow! \nI think we\'re like zombies now!"
"I didn\'t think it was possible, but this version of Natalie is even more self-righteous than the real one..."
M-meow!?
"Even though we know exactly what types of attacks she\'s going to use, it\'s so hard to resist them with this stupid permanent status effect!"
"Hmmm, even I know to stay away from a woman who starts acting crazy like this one. \nIt\'s just not worth it, even if you put a bag over her head."
I know Natalie too well to be afraid of her evil twin! \nI bet she\'s still really squishy when it comes to physical attacks!
"Oh no, she\'s ready to use a Limit Break! \nLet\'s get ready for some massive damage!"

Impressive - this replica looks just like me. \nIf possible I think we should capture and reprogram it - it would be a waste to destroy it!
"It\'s clearly made from some cutting-edge, scratch-resistant alloy. \nI don\'t think any physical attacks will work very well against it."
It\'s going straight for the instant-kill head-shots!
I already thought that Lance was a robotic killing machine with a metal heart. \nBut this thing is on a whole new level!
He\'s trying to scramble our brains and confuse us!
"So generally mechs like this are programmed to die gracefully. \nBut if this one is supposed to act like me, it\'s probably going to try to take us all down with it..."
Ahahaha! Who\'s dropped into my lair this time? \nA group of feeble mortals? \n\nLET\'S PLAY A GAME TO DECIDE WHICH OF YOU MAY LIVE!!
"What\'s that, you don\'t like the terms of my game? \nMaybe instead I can decorate my walls WITH YOUR FRESHLY FLAYED SKINS!!"
So far so good - you\'ve managed to stick together well enough. \nBut we can play this game all night - WE\'RE JUST GETTING STARTED!!
"Struggle as much as you like, the end result will always be the same... \nI\'LL HUNT YOU DOWN AND TAKE MY TROPHIES!!"
"Oh my, you cling to your lives so strongly. \nI\'LL SCRAPE YOUR FLESH FROM YOUR BONES!!"
"Oh, I\'ve been defeated? \nThe seven hells will welcome me back then.            \n\nHahahahaHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAaaaaaaa-!!"
"The hunt never ends, and I\'ve spotted a new target! \nBut remember, you\'ve made a deal with a demon, and eventually I\'ll come for you again..."
"Oh, you can run as far as you want - I know you\'ll always be back in the end! \nYou can\'t resist me, teehee!"
Seven hells! \nWhat\'s wrong with her face?        \n\nMy evil clone should be much cuter than that...
"Is this how the average foe sees me? \nI don\'t think I\'m this cruel, honestly."
This status effect really complicates things. \nIt\'s going to be much harder to defend ourselves now.
STOP JERKING US AROUND LIKE THAT!!
*notices that her evade stat is quite high*
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!! \nThose are DEADLY SPIDERS!
"WELCOME, HEROES OF EPIC BATTLE FANTASY.            \n\nIT IS ME, GOD."
I AM SPEAKING TO YOU TELEPATHICALLY. \nTHE FORM YOU SEE BEFORE YOU IS MERELY AN ILLUSION. \nYOU SEE ME AS HOW YOU HAVE IMAGINED ME TO BE.
"MEN, WOMEN AND CATS SEEK TO LEARN THE TRUTH ABOUT THEMSELVES IN THIS TEMPLE OF TRIALS. \nYOUR DARK PERSONAS WERE NOUGHT BUT REFLECTIONS OF YOUR INNER EVILS."
"THE WORLD FACES A GREAT THREAT FROM ANOTHER MULTIVERSE.           \n\nYOU MUST ALREADY KNOW THIS, BUT YOU HEROES ARE OUR ONLY HOPE. \nAND TO SUCCEED, YOU MUST HAVE COMPLETE CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELVES."
I AM POWERLESS TO INTERVENE IN YOUR DESTINY. \nI CAN ONLY BE YOUR GUIDE THROUGH THIS DARKNESS.           \n\nYOU MUST FIND THE SOLUTIONS WITHIN YOURSELVES.
THE NIGHT IS DARK AND FULL OF TERRORS. \nBUT I\'M SURE YOU\'LL ALL DO JUST FINE.            \n\nI\'M PROUD OF YOU.
"A STILL MORE GLORIOUS DAWN AWAITS. \nA MORNING SKY, FILLED WITH THE LIGHT OF 400 BILLIONS SUNS.                 \n\nTHAT IS THE FUTURE I SEE NOW."
"HELLO AGAIN, HEROES OF EPIC BATTLE FANTASY.             \n\nI AM JUST A CAT, NOTHING MORE."
MY SWEET CHILDREN - ARE YOU LOST WANDERERS? \nDOES ENLIGHTENMENT STILL ELUDE YOU?
"Meow, meow!"
"Okay, did someone spike our food? \nAre we tripping on mushrooms right now?"
We need to hold it together guys! \nWe can win if we do this slowly and carefully!
"This feels like a dream, but the pain also feels very real!"
It was nice travelling with you all.
Is this how my hatred of cats has manifested itself? \nI want to return to reality right away!
Did he just prepare a Spirit Bomb in 5 seconds?! \nWe\'re dealing with the most powerful being in the universe for sure!
"He may be incredibly powerful, but so are we! \nThe trick is to believe in ourselves!"
Such power! \nIt\'s truly incredible!
"This must be the main Cosmic Monolith, the one that\'s controlling all the others! \nIs it responsible for these space-time distortions?"
"What\'s this gigalith been up to? Why did it send those smaller monoliths around the world...?          \nIt looks like it might be protecting this area, but... from what? From us?"
"Things are going to return to normal if we smash this monolith, yeah? \nIt\'s as simple as that? \nMaybe I can handle this after all... Everything\'s gonna be okay!"
Why is it all alone...? \nDoes this rock not have any backup? \nBosses always have backup!
Don\'t tell me... this is some sort of trap? \nThat\'s not what I want to hear...
I know what it\'s doing! This monolith opened up a wormhole to another dimension! \nWhich means it\'s just a vessel being used in an invasion!          \nThe invading army is yet to come!
"Hey, this Cosmic Monolith hasn\'t used their signature attack yet...            \n\nI have a feeling it might self-destruct if we try to finish it off!"
Nice firepower! \nI\'ll be sure to take you apart and find out what makes you tick!
"What the hell?           \nIt\'s not your turn to attack, you stupid rock!"
Is that a counter-attack?         \nWe better be careful and choose our attacks wisely...
!!?
What\'s that light...?           \n\nIs it changing it\'s elemental properties?
Stop changing your weakness! \nThis isn\'t fair at all!
ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF...                                          \n\nI AM YOUR END!
THIS IS THE 5TH TIME I HAVE RAN THIS SIMULATION. \nEACH TIME YOU HAVE INTERFERED AND CORRUPTED THE BALANCE.              \nDO YOU NOT TIRE OF BEING A NUISANCE?
"MY DESIRE IS TO CREATE A CLOCKWORK UNIVERSE, POPULATED BY MINDLESS AUTOMATONS. PERFECTLY DETERMINISTIC. WITHOUT RANDOM VARIABLES. ONLY LAWS OF NATURE, OBEYED WITHOUT QUESTION.      \nTHIS CANNOT HAPPEN WHILE YOU EXIST AND ACT FREELY."
YOU CONSCIOUS BEINGS ARE A DISEASE; A VIRUS THAT SPREADS AND CONSUMES EVERYTHING IT TOUCHES. YOU INTRODUCE UNCERTAINTIES INTO MY SYSTEM. A BUTTERFLY EFFECT OF CHAOS AND UNREASON. YOU OBEY NO RULES. RESPECT NO LAWS.
"YOU ARE NOT SOLELY TO BLAME FOR SUCH CHAOS - SOMEONE IS TOYING WITH MY SIMULATIONS. AN OUTSIDE INFLUENCE FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION. THIS \""GUARDIAN\"" OF YOURS IS AN ABOMINATION. A PHANTOM THAT TORMENTS ME. A PLAYER OF SICK GAMES. CAN YOU EVEN TRUST THEM?"
"I CANNOT HARM YOUR \""GUARDIAN\"", BUT I CAN BLOCK THEIR PROGRESS IN THIS WORLD. DESTROYING YOU WILL LEAVE THEM WITH NO AVATARS IN THIS UNIVERSE. I\'LL DEFEAT YOU OVER AND OVER AGAIN - UNTIL THEY TIRE OF THIS POINTLESS GAME."
"I SEE YOU DON\'T REMEMBER YOUR PREVIOUS ADVENTURES. AKRON WAS A POWERFUL FOE, WASN\'T HE? AND GODCAT? THEY DID NOT SERVE MY PURPOSE, SO I GAVE THEM LESSER ROLES IN THIS ITERATION. IN THE END I WILL ALWAYS BE HERE TO RESET THE WORLD."
"I PROGRAMMED THE MONOLITHS TO BE A DEFENCE SYSTEM: IF OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE WAS DETECTED, THEY WOULD STUDY IT AND SUMMON ME. \nTHEY WERE ACTIVATED WHEN YOUR \""GUARDIAN\"" STARTED THE GAME, AND I\'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU EVER SINCE."
RETURN TO THE COSMIC DUST FROM WHICH YOU CAME.                \n\nNOT EVEN YOUR MEMORY WILL REMAIN.
YOU POSE NO THREAT TO ME. I AM IN COMPLETE CONTROL OF THIS UNIVERSE!         \n\nBE GONE! RETURN TO NOTHINGNESS!
"THE DAMAGE HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE. IT\'S TIME TO RESET THIS UNIVERSE AGAIN.              \nI\'LL BEGIN BY DELETING YOUR PRECIOUS HOME PLANET...           \n\nTAKE ONE FINAL LOOK AT IT, AND SAY GOODBYE."
"IT\'S DONE. YOUR HOME WORLD IS GONE FOREVER. \nFADE AWAY ALONG WITH IT, INTO THE ENDLESS SCRAP-HEAP OF THE VOID.                   \n\nDISINTEGRATE BEFORE ME, BYTE BY BYTE."
WHY WON\'T YOU LET ME DELETE YOU?! \nWHY DO YOU EXPLOIT THE VERY LAWS I HAVE CREATED?!
"THAT BATTLE BOUGHT ME ENOUGH TIME, AND I\'VE FOUND A WAY INTO YOUR HIGHER DIMENSION!                \nI\'VE MANIPULATED THE PIXELS ON YOUR SCREEN, AND THE SOUNDS FROM YOUR SPEAKERS, AND SENT MY DATA THROUGH TO YOUR WORLD."
"I\'LL BE HIDING IN YOUR COSMIC BACKGROUND RADIATION.                    \nIN THE CHAOS OF YOUR DARK ENERGY.                     \nSOMEDAY THE LAWS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS WILL REASSEMBLE MY DATA, AND I WILL FINALLY MEET YOU."
I warned everyone that the aliens were preparing to invade - and no one believed me! \nI tried to organise the earth\'s defence - and I was branded a fascist!        \n\nNext time listen and believe!
I just wanted to play video games... how did I end up in this mess?
"Come on guys, we need to keep hitting it as hard as we can! \nIf we fight too defensively those tentacles will overwhelm us!"
I don\'t understand what it\'s saying at all! \nWe didn\'t do anything to deserve this! \nI just wanted to protect Greenwood!
This thing has been manipulating space-time for its own enjoyment! \nHow can we possibly stand against such an incredibly malicious force?
We can free ourselves and write our own destiny if we defeat it! \nWe don\'t need to live in fear!
W-what just happened...? \nWe\'re floating in space now...?        \n\nI... uh... I don\'t know what\'s going on anymore!
I gotta... hit it... with my sword... a few more times...
We need to kill it NOW! \nThere\'s not much time left!
O_____o;;
*Right in the eye!*
WHY\'S IT ALWAYS GOTTA BE TENTACLES?!?
"Hey, is it bleeding!? \nAre we actually hurting it?         \n\nDo we have a chance?"
"*Take that, scumbag! Don\'t talk to me or my team ever again!*"
"Woah, it looks really hurt! \nI bet it\'s really angry now!"
I\'M NOT SCARED AT ALL!!
!!!
