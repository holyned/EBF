"□□□□□□□□□□□□Oh snap, I\'m down to my last few hit points again. \nHis attacks do so much damage - it\'s not fair!                   \n\nAnd his stupid attack pattern keeps changing every time!"
"I\'ve only got one life left - if I lose again I\'m going all the way back to the start.             \n\nI\'ve got other things to do, I don\'t want to be trapped in here forever!"
"Aha! There\'s his weak spot! \nIf I can just stab him in the eye a few more times, then... maybe..."
I DID IT! HE\'S DEAD!         \n\nI finally finished the game!
It only took me 23 tries to beat the final boss!         \n\nI\'m such a pro!
This ending is kind of lame though. \nI spent weeks collecting every single item... and this is all I get?           \n\nI hope there\'s more to it than this-
WHAT THE HELL?!              \n\nWhat the crap was that?
"Is Hope Harbor being invaded by pirates again? \nNah, there\'s no way that pirates would have that much firepower... right?"
I\'m not gonna let this slide. \nWhoever did this to my TV is gonna pay!        \n\nI didn\'t even get to see the rest of the ending!
Here we go. \nI can use this old hockey stick as a weapon. \nI think that should be enough equipment for now.
"Hmmm, I think I\'m ready to go.    \nMaybe I should grab some snacks from the fridge too..."
"Huh, old Jerry doesn\'t seem to be home.       \n\nI wonder what happened to him? \nHe never goes out..."
"Hmm, using mouse controls for secrets like this feels a bit like cheating.           \n\nI guess I\'ve got the option to walk around with the keyboard if I want a more classic JRPG experience."
Meow?
"This cat probably doesn\'t know what I\'m talking about...        \nOld JRPGs had some cryptic secrets, yo."
Huh?             \n\nI forgot that I had a room back here...
Eh...               \n\nIt smells in here.
Meow...                \nMeow!
"Well you would like it, wouldn\'t you? \nCats love filth!"
Myeh...
"I like passing through here to look at the swords, but I\'ve never had the cash to actually buy anything. \nThe shopkeeper always gives me a mean look - I think he\'s hiding a dark secret."
"Eh, there\'s some odd types in here today.               \n\nNever seen it so busy before."
"Meh, meow? \nMeeeow?"
"Nah, this place won\'t give any leftovers to bums like you. \n(I\'ve tried it myself...)"
"Woah, what the hell? \nThere\'s a huge fireball in the sky!"
"Oh wait, I see - that\'s just the sun.       \n\nHaven\'t seen that in a while... I better be careful out here."
"There\'s some monsters up ahead - one might even call them \""foes\"".            \nAnd if I know anything about foes, it\'s that they drop loot when they\'re defeated - so it\'s time to get to work!"
But they\'re just standing around peacefully for some reason. \nI might have to talk to them to spark things off...
What\'s this? \nI sense an ambush up ahead...        \n\nDoes he think I can\'t see him?
"I think it\'s the cat that\'s been stealing my trash. \nWell I\'ve had a few practice battles, I bet I can take on a cat now!"
"Stay back, you beast! \nYou can\'t trick me with your crocodile tears! \nWhy were you stealing my garbage?"
Meeeowwww....
"What\'s that? You want to join my party? \nYou may be a worthy ally after all, little cat.          \n\nWhat\'s your name?"
Meow!
"NoLegs? What a strange yet fitting name! \nI was planning on cooking you, but I\'ll keep you around for a while instead. \nWe can be partners in crim- er, adventure!"
M-meow?
"Yeah, that\'s right. \nI\'m on a quest for revenge, and also for treasure!         \n\nStick with me and we\'ll be rich in no time!"
"Hey, we\'re both getting quite good at whacking foes. \nMaybe we should try learning some new attacks in the \""Skills\"" menu?"
Meow...?  \nMeow!?
"Yeah, I think that\'s how we spend the Ability Points we get from battles!"
"Oh no, I remember these people. \nThey always try to convince me to collect crap for them.        \n\nWell I\'m not going to be an errand boy!"
"Meow, meow... meow!"
You think they\'ll reward us with something good? \nI really doubt that - they don\'t look very rich.
What\'s with all of these block puzzles? \nWho designs this crap and just leaves it outside to torment me?
"□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Wow, we\'re making bank already! \nThese foes are just standing around and waiting for us to rob them! \nAnd there\'s so many treasure chests just lying around!"
Meow!
"Yeah, you\'re a pretty good ally!      \n\nI think I\'ll let you keep 10% of our treasure, since you\'re about ten times smaller than me and don\'t need so much stuff."
*not pleased at all*
"□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Woah, what in the name of Godcat is that? \nThat giant black rock isn\'t supposed to be there!          \n\nDid it fall from the sky? Is that what shook my house?"
*hisses at the monolith*
"Yeah, I agree. \nThis looks like a bad omen of some sort.       \n\nI feel like it\'s watching me somehow - even though it\'s just a stupid rock!"
*Ah-choo!*
"Lame - these side roads are blocked off by dirt! \nA shovel would really help, and I bet we can steal one at the Farmer\'s Market.       \n\nWe just gotta keep pushing forward until we find a way there..."
"Hold on, I\'m not sure if this is mentioned anywhere... But I think I can close menus by right-clicking anywhere! \nThat could speed things up a bit... "
"Hmm, it looks like we heal quite quickly outside of battle. \nBut it\'s not instant, so we might have to wait a minute sometimes..."
I guess that\'s a chance to upgrade some skills or equipment!
"Ah, here we go. This is the Farmer\'s Market.        \nWe can grab that shovel over there, and maybe a few other things if we don\'t get caught."
Meow!
"Yeah, I thought you might be up for a bit of thievery. \nWe make a good team!"
"A-are you okay? How are you feeling? \nWe weren\'t trying to cause any major trouble, I promise."
My head\'s spinning... w-what happened?
Can we forget this whole confrontation ever happened? \nLet\'s move away from here before anyone starts asking questions...
Meow!
"Oh, you\'re right! \nI think she\'s sobering up.            \nGotta make up an alibi fast!"
What happened to me? \nDid the thieves get away?
"Hey, we\'re Matt and NoLegs, just a bunch of chumps looking to fight monsters and do good deeds. \n\nYup, that\'s us. \nYou just fainted for a while."
"□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Oh, I remember now. \nYou jerks were caught stealing, and then YOU ATTACKED ME!           \n\nPlease explain yourselves."
"Super sorry about that. \nWe just didn\'t want to go to jail - we didn\'t even steal anything valuable yet. \nWe\'re still stretching our wings and learning the ropes around here, or something like that."
"(Hmm, maybe I can use these morons for the time being... if they\'ll cooperate.)"
"Well you put up a good fight at least. Perhaps we can work together for a while.         \nThere\'s a lot of monsters around lately - probably due to that meteor. \nI\'ve been sent on a mission to investigate the monoliths that fell alongside it, and could use some help."
"We\'re on a mission too - to find treasure, and food, and to get stronger! \nWe\'ve already learned a lot out here."
Meowth! \n(That\'s right!)
"Alright then, let\'s use that shovel you\'ve \""borrowed\"" and head to the coast. \nWith all of the bridges having been knocked out, our only way off of this island is through the Ice Cave to the south-east.         \n\nThere might be a few big monsters along the way - but nothing we can\'t handle together!"
"Ya, hear that NoLegs? \nWe\'re going on a proper adventure, far away from home!"
:3
"Oh, and I\'m Natalie by the way. \nPleased to meet you both."
Ace! There\'s more stuff back here! \nWe can sneak past the shopkeepers like ninjas!
"Aha, there\'s something hidden back here. \nAlmost missed this one."
Really? \nWe\'re gonna steal from this friendly family?
"I\'m sorry Natalie, but this is just how the game is played. \nI\'m sure you\'ll get used to it eventually."
"*sigh*             \n\n(I\'m gonna make this right someday, I swear.)"
"So, uh, Natalie."
Yeah? \nWhat\'s up?
"What sort of things are you into? \nLike, uh, hobbies I mean.                \n\nDo you like video games? \'Cause I do."
"Um, I\'ve been playing a lot of addictive puzzle games on my phone lately. \nI\'ve also got a DS with a bunch of mystery solving games.          \n\nThose are really fun to play while I\'m travelling. ^_^"
"Oh, I don\'t like puzzle games.         \n\nThose kind of suck, in my opinion."
Whatever.
"Hey, there\'s some shops near here, right? \nI think this is a good chance to grab any healing items we\'re short on, and upgrade some equipment.         \n\nOh, and get some snacks for NoLegs, too!"
"Mehehe, Meow! \nMeow!"
"What do you mean? Are you saying she\'d make a better leader than me? \nAre you going to betray me already, NoLegs? \nDon\'t make me regret not eating you."
Meow...
That\'s a horrible thing to say to your pet! \nYou can\'t treat NoLegs like that!
"(Oh, she\'s mad...)               \n\nHeh heh heh, I\'m totally just kidding, right NoLegs?"
...
"This stone block looks big, but it\'s actually surprisingly light. \nEven NoLegs could push it.          \n\nWe can just push it out of the way and continue south."
"Okay, that thing over there by the cave is definitely a boss."
"Yeah, that\'s the Ice Cave! \nLet\'s look around first and not rush into this."
"Yeah, we did it! \nI was worried for a while, but we really showed him who\'s boss!         \nI think we really balance out each other\'s weaknesses, and make a great team."
I just hit things with my sword. \nI\'m glad you\'ve got every other position covered.
"You should give yourself more credit! \nYou\'re tough and won\'t go down easily, that helps a lot in battles like these!"
"He kept hitting me, but I wanted to win so badly that I took the hits and just kept on fighting. \nSometimes the pain just made me angrier and even stronger!           \n\n(Am I finally useful? Have I found my purpose in life?!)"
"Meow, meow!"
"I-it\'s not like that! \nAnd of course we haven\'t forgotten about you, NoLegs. \nYou fought awesomely too."
*purrs*
W-WOAH!! \nDid that slime cat bring me here?
Or did I die and go to heaven?          \nThat might be more likely...
"Woah, this place looks super fancy. \nI\'ve got a feeling I won\'t be treated nicely around here..."
"So apparently we\'ve earned enough of a reputation to be allowed in here, huh? \nI guess we\'re moving up in the world."
"It\'s a very nice gallery. \nI visit regularly and help out with cataloguing the new artwork sometimes. \nLately there\'s been, well... a lot of artwork of us showing up."
"Eh, we\'ve got fanart?! \nPeople have heard of us?"
Seems that way. \nWe\'ve got quite a few fans!
W-WHAT!? \nI didn\'t give them permission to put this one up!
*choking*
Such lewdness...           \n\nIncredible...
Wow...        \n\nJust wow...
I thought the pose was a bit too suggestive... So I wanted to keep this photo private. \n(I was also a bit chubbier at the time... and got some really mean comments about it...)
"I guess putting it on the internet was a bad idea... It\'s out there forever, right?"
Meow...!?
Beer\'s not for cats though!
...
"I have no idea who this is. \nDo you know her, NoLegs?"
Nya...?
"Yeah, that\'s totally me! \nI\'m not wearing baggy clothes to hide my beer belly or anything. \nI\'m actually ripped, as you can see!"
"Oh great, I\'m already seeing some dirty drawings of me in here. \nWho\'s been stalking me?"
Are my boobs really that big?          \n\nI\'m surprised that some people can be so obsessed with them.                \nMaybe I should be used to this sort of attention by now...?
"At least the artwork is good, Natalie! \nI think it\'s all made in good faith - you just have a lot of fans who think you\'re pretty!"
Yay for being famous!
"(I don\'t know how else to comfort her in this situation. \nI think she looks great, but maybe this isn\'t the time to bring that up.)"
*Staring at the drawing and drooling*
"Hey, I look really cute here. \nThis is a good drawing!"
"Wow, we\'ve defeated some powerful foes in our past lives! \nThat\'s some vicious, nightmarish stuff, right there."
"Pffft, nonsense. \nThey\'ve been made to look more impressive in painting form. \nThey weren\'t so tough in real life."
"Woah, this room is full of paintings of us! \nWe\'ve gotten really famous in just a few days!"
This will make excellent propaganda! \nPerhaps my poor reputation can be repaired!
This painting really shows off how cool I am. \nI like it!
"Hmm, I don\'t remember this happening...          \nBut at the same time... it feels oddly familiar."
I wonder what we\'re reacting to in this painting. \nIt must have been good.
The announcement of Epic Battle Fantasy Dating Sim?
"Quiet, you."
It\'s all of us! \nWe look so dynamic!
"For some reason I always look a bit grumpy in these drawings, while everyone else looks like they\'re having a good time."
It looks correct. \nYou\'re always a bit grumpy.
"Pffft, that\'s debatable."
"We really make a good team, huh? \nYou can really see it in these drawings."
"Woah, this is amazing! \nI look really powerful here!"
Too bad that equipment isn\'t in this game though... it\'s from Epic Battle Fantasy 3!           \n\nOr was it 4...?
We look dead serious here.
I\'m always dead serious.
Why are we all dead? \nWhat in seven hells happened here?
I like this one. \nI see nothing wrong here.
"Eh Natalie, we almost look like a couple or something here. \nHaha, that\'s cute."
"W-what?      \nI mean, yeah, that\'s silly. We\'re not THAT close.         \n(But maybe someday though? You never know, right?)"
"I\'m a real cutie, huh?"
See? Just like this!
"This is totally me. \nI\'m obviously ripped like that. \nI don\'t have a beer belly at all, those are just lies."
I will strive to be the super cool person this artist thinks I can be!
(You gotta grow up first...)
"Wow, I look so realistic here! \nWell, compared to my current deformed cartoon form."
(I\'m feeling so pudgy right now...)
"Woahhhh, this is me?              \nSo cool!"
"Hey, there\'s a delicious babe on the wall.                 \n\nAnd she\'s smiling at me. <3"
That\'s not an expression you\'ll ever see from me in real life!
The background\'s so pretty! \nThis looks like somewhere I\'d love to be - it looks a lot like Greenwood!
"Yup, that\'s a dragon, and a massive one at that. \nBut we\'re so strong now that we can defeat anything!"
"Ewww, it\'s my evil clone!"
"Holy Godcat, have we found heaven?! \nThis is... everything is made of gold!"
*Blinded by beauty*
(I... forgot to wipe my shoes...)
"I know this is just concept art, but I\'m glad that some of these monstrosities didn\'t make it into the game."
"Some of the older EBF games had turtles in them, right?"
"Yeah, but they didn\'t look quite like this. \nThese are a bit different."
A bird that poops eggs at you? An overturned ice cream cone?           \n\nThese would be joke enemies if they existed! \nI require something much more challenging.
"Wow, these monster designs are dumb. \nThese are for kids - they look really cartoony and silly."
"You ARE a cartoon! \nYou know that, right?"
"Pffft, not like this though. \nI\'ve got style."
"Hey NoLegs, are you really a cyborg like this sketch here? \nBecause that would give me much cause for concern. \nWhat would we find if we dissected you?"
*Internal error*
"Eww, spiders.            \n\nI\'m not afraid of them or anything, they just really creep out."
"I\'d like to say that spiders are the sign of a healthy household, but if they get that big then you might have a problem. \nYou need to get the flamethrower out at some point."
"Huh, it seems that some of the skimpy outfits in this game were designed by a woman? \nIt looks like even the ladies want to show off my curves. \nI\'m cursed with a body that cannot be contained."
"Wow, what a curse. \nIt must be so hard to have everyone throwing themselves at your feet. \n(I\'m obviously not jealous or anything...)"
M-meow...!
"Yeah, ice is slippery. \nIt might feel a bit more intuitive to use the keyboard while walking on it, but I shouldn\'t be telling you how to play anymore. \nI think you\'ve got the hang of the game by now."
(Who is he talking to? Is someone watching us?)
"H-hey, wait. There\'s something I need to ask...             \nSince we teamed up I\'ve been having this weird sense of déjà vu. \nHave we met before? \nOr am I remembering some sort of dream?"
"Now that you mention it...               \nThis is starting to feel like some of the RPGs I\'ve played, yeah! \nIt\'s a really common trope: A guy meets a girl under funny circumstances and they start travelling together."
"No, that\'s not what I meant - I\'m not talking about video games. \nAh, never mind..."
"Damn, this cave goes on for a while. \nAre you sure there\'s an end to this?"
"Yeah, I\'m sure. \nI\'ve been through here before, it\'s just that, well... I\'ll tell you something when we get to the end."
"Ah, daylight! \nWe\'re on a different continent and- what the hell is that castle over there? \nWho are those mean-looking guys in black coats?"
*cat hissing sounds*
"Heh, well, the thing about that is... I didn\'t just need backup for that cyclops back there. \nThis is a big, dangerous world, and it just so happens that there\'s a fortress full of fascists over there, and they\'re preparing to start a war. \nI didn\'t want to scare you earlier, but we need to sneak past here - it\'s the only road forward."
"Ahhhh, you\'ve been hiding things from us. Very naughty! \nBut this is good news - we can test out our new powers on some proper bad guys. \nAnd I\'m sure you\'ll have no objections if we raid this castle for treasure, eh?"
You\'re not scared? Or angry at me? \nThat\'s excellent to hear.
"If loot is all you care about, then there\'s sure to be a lot of that ahead. \nJust be careful not to get shot too many times. \nI know you\'re strong enough to take a few shots to the face, but you\'ll die eventually."
Let\'s go for it. \nYou can stand behind me for safety if you like.
Meow!
This is horrible. \nThe destruction is so much worse now.        \n\nThis used to be lush woodlands around here!
"Wow, something REALLY BIG made this mess. \nI\'d be terrified if I wasn\'t so impressed."
"I\'m no track expert, but it seems like these fascists have got a very big car. \nOne big enough to mow down trees - and probably us too."
"But on the bright side, we\'d see something huge like that coming from a mile away! \nWe\'ll definitely be ready to fight it!"
"I suppose that\'s true. \nIt\'ll be an easy target for my magic, that\'s for sure."
Meeeow!
What the hell was that? It came out of nowhere!            \n\nI\'ve got the worst headache imaginable... 
"Are you alive, NoLegs? \nDid you get hit?!            \n\nSay something to me - meow twice if you\'re okay!"
M-meow... meow...
W-what? Natalie\'s gone!?           \nHe took her! That scary guy took her!
Well I guess there\'s no question about what to do next: \nWe gotta go after them! No one steals from me and gets away with it!             \n\nAnd also who knows what he\'s gonna do to Natalie?!
"Meow, meow!"
"We\'re down one party member, but I\'m sure we\'ll manage. \nWe got cocky is all, we\'re gonna be more careful this time."
"Wow, this fortress is massive.           \n\nI hope Natalie\'s okay."
Myehehehe. \nMeow!
Now\'s not the time for dirty jokes like that! \nYou take that back!
A chill just ran down my spine.            \nThere\'s another angry girl standing in front of me. \nThis is all too familiar now.
*Accusing stare*
"What\'s that? You think she\'s here to fight the bad guys, and not us? \nYeah, that makes more sense.            \nMaybe we can explain our situation and join forces!"
I shouldn\'t be too optimistic. \nI\'m probably gonna have a bad time if I take another step.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□I\'m still alive? I\'m free to go?                 \nWhy? What is this?
"For Godcat\'s sake, we\'re not your enemies! \nWe\'re also here to fight the \""dark-coats\""! \nThey stole my friend Natalie and they\'re gonna invade my village! \nWill you just relax and let us talk?!"
Meow!
Ehh?
"This was all just a misunderstanding all along!? \nI just saw that- and thought that- oh, well. \nI goofed."
"You don\'t say. \nMaybe I\'ve done some wrong in the past, but not today - use your brain next time!"
I guess I owe you both an apology. \nI wasn\'t planning on killing you or anything like that - I was just acting tough. \nI didn\'t mean some of the things I said earlier.
"Ya\'ll looked pretty scared though, hehehe. \nI think I fooled you good."
"I don\'t think you\'re in a position to joke about this. \nAfter what you pulled on us, I think you owe us some favours."
"Alright, fair enough.                  \n\nSo what\'s your plan then?"
"Well I\'m good at hitting things with my sword, and so is NoLegs, so that\'s what we\'re gonna do! \nWe\'ll smash anything that stands in our way - man or machine!"
"So you\'re just going to stab your way through that huge wall then? \nWe need to be sneaky here, and get round the fascists\' traps and defences."
Fair point. \nLet\'s proceed with caution.
"I\'m Anna, by the way. \nI fight for my home, the village of Greenwood!                   \n\nYou\'ve met me on a bad day. I\'m usually a nice lass - I swear!"
So what\'s Natalie like then? \nYou know each other well?
Mememe-meow! \n*makes kissy faces*
"Shut up, NoLegs! \nShe\'s not my \""love interest\""!"
"She just so happens to be a very effective ally. \nShe\'s smart, diplomatic, and can do magic!                  \n\nHaving her around made our adventure much easier and more exciting."
Meow!
Anyway! \nThis looks like the entrance to the fortress. \nJust gotta deal with that big guy over there!
We\'re in! \nNow we just need to find where the captives are kept!
Please don\'t attack everyone in sight. \nI can\'t believe I have to say that - I\'m usually on the receiving end of such comments.
Can you blame me for getting a little bit emotional when my home is under seige?
I just eat and play video games when I get emotional.                   \nBut I guess I\'ve lived a sheltered life so far - I\'m sure learning a lot today.
Is that Natalie over there? \nIn that jail cell?
"No, that\'s not her. \nBut we should still help him regardless - he might give us a reward."
"I\'m just messing with you.                    \n\nYeah, let\'s not leave him in there. \nLet\'s find the switch that opens the gate."
"More boosters, huh? \nThis looks fun..."
I\'m very dizzy after all that. \nI don\'t feel so good.
"Wait, give me a moment!"
"Okay, I feel a little bit better now..."
Nope! \nStill wanna puke!
MATT AND NOLEGS! \nOVER HERE!
Natalie! You\'re okay! \nWe\'re gonna get you out of there ASAP!                 \n\nAre you hurt? What have they done to you?
"Nothing yet, but they\'ve got some messed up plans for us. \nJust wait \'til I can tell you more, oh boy.          \n\nThis Lance guy is a real nutcase."
"□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□(Wow, so that\'s Natalie. I should have expected someone with incredible curves.             \nI can see why men would fight over her, but this is a bit extreme.)"
"Hmm, how do we actually get you out of here? \nThe authority of those spikes is unquestionable, and they won\'t react to swords."
"Find their laboratory! \nThe switch is in there!                 \n\nThey\'ve also got one of those huge black monoliths in there, so be careful!"
Black monolith!?
*hissing and spitting*
"Oh snap, that\'s him. \nLet\'s get him before he sees us!"
"Haha, he runs fast - what a coward! \nWe\'ve got him on the run now!"
"Yeah, I think we\'ve got him now. \nHe can\'t defend his fortress if he can\'t even face us in battle!"
Nya nya nya!
Oh right - he\'s still got his huge car somewhere! \nI totally forgot about that.
"Gee, these guys have been busy.                 \nIt could have been me locked in there."
It\'s these guys again! \nThese blondies insulted me earlier!
"Ah, there we go. \nFound the way!"
"Meow, meow!         \n\nNya!"
"Yeah, I guess this is a nice room for a rave. \nDidn\'t think you\'d be into loud music - but I guess lasers and lights are a cat thing."
Meow!
"Catnip is the best party drug?         \nWhat have you been getting up to, exactly?"
"Oh geez, it\'s a monolith! \nStay away!"
Yeah? One of these landed on my island. \nIt didn\'t seem to do very much.             \n\nIt\'s just a rock.
"No, no no no. I\'ve seen what they do. \nThey corrupt every living thing around them - their dark energy creeps in and causes aggression and violence."
"Maybe the dark-coats got a bit too close, and are being controlled by it? \nIs that what you mean?"
I think they\'re still to blame for their actions. \nThe monoliths seem to have a much greater effect on beasts than on humans. \nI think the dark-coats have started farming them for resources...
"Hey, NoLegs. \nYou\'re a beast, I think.      \nIs the monolith affecting you?"
Meow?
I guess that settles it. \nWe need to shut down this operation!
Matt! You did it! \nI knew I hired the right bodyguard for the job!
It was nothing - and I don\'t think you\'re paying me. \nBut I\'ve been handsomely rewarded already with all of the loot we found in here.
Well it\'s not so much that I doubted your intentions... I just wasn\'t sure if you\'d be able to break in here on your own. \nBut it looks like you found some help along the way.
"I\'m Anna by the way. \nI\'ve heard a lot about you, Natalie. \nYou\'re quite a prize."
"Ehhhhh, what have you told her? \nWhy is she giving me cheek?"
"I didn\'t tell her anything weird, honest! \nIt was all NoLegs!"
"Blaming the cat, huh? Real smooth.        \n\nAnyway, I don\'t want to spend another minute in here. \nLet\'s make like a cannon ball and fly."
"Oh, one more thing. \nThere\'s an important item in the treasure chest over there. \nIt\'s a hammer that will help us clear the road and let us continue our quest."
A hammer? \nYou couldn\'t just use that to escape your jail cell?
"Haha, I wish. It\'s a special type of hammer than can only destroy cracked boulders. \nOddly specific - I know.         \n(I\'m also not very strong... don\'t rub it in.)"
"Alright, we\'ve finished our business in here. \nBut that lunatic is still waiting for us to fight him, and it looks like he\'s fully armed this time."
There\'s a 2nd exit on the west side of the castle - we can use that to retreat for a while if we need to buy more items from Hope Harbor. I\'ve also got a bit of AP to spend on some new skills! \n\nBut we need to defeat Lance eventually - he\'s insane and very dangerous.
I ain\'t afraid! \nLet\'s take him on right now!
How could this have happened...? \nI can\'t believe I lost to a bunch of disorganised thugs...
"Hey, dingus! \nYou\'re our prisoner now - you\'re lucky we\'re the good guys and didn\'t finish you off! \nTell us what you were doing with the black monoliths!"
"Hmmm, and what if I refuse to cooperate?"
Do you really think you\'re in a position to negotiate after what you\'ve done?       \nShall we let our cat rearrange your face?
Meow!
"Well, I value my face highly. \nI will cast my pride aside and do as you ask.            \n\nThe monoliths... well..."
"Around the same time that the Great Impact happened, several of those monoliths were spotted on our radars. \nThey landed far apart from each other, as if they were intentionally distributed. \nPerhaps they are some sort of scouting device being used by the enemy."
"Huh, what enemy is that?"
"Humanity\'s enemy, of course! \nThe monoliths are incredible machines - but unlike any machines that humans have ever built. \nWe brought one back to our lab and hooked it up - they produce immense amounts of energy!"
"The problem we found, however, was that they only produce dark energy - which cancels out regular energy! \nIt\'s all quite complicated, but basically, they are not a viable energy source after all. \nBut what we did learn is that, based on the energy signature, whatever impacted the southern continent was a colossal monolith - possibly their mothership!"
Mothership?! \nYou make it sound like these are space invaders! \nThat\'s ridiculous!
"Yeah, and monoliths are just rocks! \nThey\'re not machines - even I know what a computer looks like!"
"Regardless of your uninformed opinions, humanity is not prepared for such a large-scale invasion. \nI merely took it upon myself to unite the armies of mankind and prepare our defences. \nThat is all."
"I still don\'t trust you - I\'m sure you\'re hiding a lot from us. \nBut we\'ll let you travel with us for the time being, since you know a bit about the monoliths.           \n\nThere\'s more foes to fight and we need all the help we can get."
"I think Lance is a great fighter, and will make our team even stronger!          \n\nMaybe he\'s made mistakes in the past, but now we know that we can keep him in line with violence! \nI\'m sure he\'ll do as we say!"
"Hey now, we\'re being a bit quick to forgive him, aren\'t we? \nI\'m not going to forget what he did to me!"
"(Am I really getting off so easily? Haha, amateurs!          \nI\'ll try to behave though... I don\'t want to be subjected to any torture...             \n\nI should also have a look at my new skills before we head off. I think I\'ve got some AP to burn...)"
"Okay, Lance, so I get what the monoliths in your lab were for, but why did you kidnap all of those girls? \nWhat\'s the point of that? Isn\'t one enough?"
"Because he\'s the greatest moron that\'s ever lived, that\'s why."
"Well, actually, I thought a great deal about this. Every detail has been meticulously planned out. \nThe monoliths would be the energy supply for my perfect empire, and the girls would be the human supply. I simply picked the fittest of the species to reproduce with and to populate my empire. I thought it was a brilliant plan - but neither part worked out."
See! \nHe\'s a megalomaniacal despot!          \n\nAmong other unspeakable things...
That\'s messed up man. \nWe\'re gonna be keeping a lot of eyes on you at all times. \nWe\'re only letting you hold on to your guns \'cause we need you to fight - don\'t you dare try anything funny.
"Pffft, you have my word that if I betray you, I won\'t be sneaky about it. \nI\'ll be honest and upfront."
It looks like there\'s no need for me to talk to my men. \nThey can see what\'s happened and they won\'t cause you any trouble.
AHA! \nNo treasure escapes my keen senses!
(I wonder how many chests we might have missed though...)
So what exactly is our plan of action now?
Well we can\'t cross the water to the southern continent yet - we\'d get swept away by the currents if we tried to swim! \nWe need to find some other way around it.
"Oh, I know! \nWe need to find a raft! \nPeople at Hope Harbor used them all the time!"
But we didn\'t see any rafts when we were there...
"They were all scuttled by huge waves when the meteor hit, I think. \nThe only guy that knows how to make them ironically lives across the river-"
"At the edge of the Mystic Woods! \nYou\'re talking about the raft maker, yeah? \nThat\'s where he lives - and we can get there if we go west from Greenwood Village."
"Yeah, let\'s head there then!"
"Alright guys, we\'re almost at Greenwood Village. \nThis is my home, so don\'t you DARE try anything funny, okay?"
"Lance, you should try to look as sorry as possible, so that you\'re not lynched for your crimes."
Like this?
"Hm, maybe. \nMatt and NoLegs, I\'ve gathered that you\'re a bunch of filthy thieves. \nSo don\'t even try stealing anything from my village!"
My reputation travels fast!
*offended by accusations*
Heyyyy...
We\'re not trespassing - there\'s no fence around this part. \nSo don\'t even TRY to accuse me of committing a crime!
"If you take anything from here, I\'ll make sure you bring it back."
There\'s something back here!
"This is my secret personal stash, so you can borrow this stuff for now."
"There\'s a lot of new houses being built, as you can see. \nThe people of Greenwood used to live in hollowed-out trees not long ago, but I guess the times are changing."
There used to be another forest called Ashwood in this area. \nBut it... ya know... burned down and stuff.            \n\nAll of this bamboo sprouted up in its place though!
"Here\'s the public library. \nIf you ever have some time to read about in-depth battle strategies, this is the place to do it. \nThey\'ve also got the only computer in the whole town!"
(What kind of backwards town is this?)
So many books! \nThis is heaven!
This is hell... \nI\'m bored already!
(So THIS is the village armory? \nThey barely have any weapons or armor! \nHow did they resist my attacks for so long? \nWere my men really so useless?)
"This is my favourite shop - cause I just love all the plants! \n(Beautiful cacti, precious fungi, and tasty herbs!)         \n\nMaybe I\'ll start my own collection someday!"
These statues were built to commemorate the heroes that protected the village during the great goblin raids. \nSo that\'s a bit of history for ya!
*yawn*
"These days I\'m the greatest hunter in the village, so I\'ll have a statue built for me someday too."
Over there to the west is the entrance to the Mystic Woods. \nWe\'ll need an axe to get in there - and I\'ve got one at home!
Strange things have been happening in there lately. \nPeople wandering off and appearing later as... uh... undead monsters. \nThey\'re attacking the village quite often now...
"So obviously, we have to go in there and investigate, right?"
"You would do that for me?! \nYou\'re a brave and virtuous ally, Matt!"
"Yeah, totally! \nI\'m really getting into this \""helping people\"" thing! \n(As long as we\'re not up against ghosts...)"
"We also need to find that raft maker who lives in those woods. \nPlus from the sounds of it, there\'s a few more items in there that should be helpful."
"Well, here\'s home. \nI can\'t believe I\'ve brought back such sketchy company.         \n\nOh dear, I\'ll probably have to introduce you to my parents."
"You still live with your parents? \nHow old are you, anyway?"
I\'m a cartoon. \nI\'m however old you want me to be. <3
(That\'s convenient!)
That was... an interesting atmosphere. \nNot at all what I expected.
You got something to complain about?!
"For once, no. \nI grew up without any parents, so that was a new experience for me."
Eh? What happened to them? \nIf... you don\'t mind me asking...
"Hmmmmm.....................................................................................................                     \n\nWell I never met my mom, and my dad died in a mine-crafting accident. \nHe was an ass, so I\'m better off without him."
Oh... that\'s really crappy.
Can I blame all of my shortcomings on my unfortunate upbringing now?
"No chance, buster.     \nPretending to be a victim is unsightly."
"Shrines like these are supposed to ward off evil and give you good luck if you pray. \nI\'m sceptical about it, but it\'s a fun tradition."
(My boobs aren\'t growing no matter how much I pray!)
"Oh, a real grumpy guy lives over there. \nI\'d leave him alone - he\'s probably hiding a dark secret!"
This is our balcony! \nAs you can see... it\'s falling apart and needs some work.          \n\nWe won\'t be able to cross those gaps until we find a stepladder.
"There\'s always more items to find, eh?! \nCan\'t we just jump across?"
Nope!
"Ahhhhh, the giant trees! \nThis is where I belong! \n\nI\'ve been away from home for far too long!"
"We gotta climb up there, by the way. \nThe forest floor is thick and swampy, and sometimes we have to take the high road to get around."
But there\'s worms up there! And it smells around here!             \n\nNature truly is disgusting...
"Shush, you. \nOr we\'ll leave you with the giant spiders."
"Woah, we\'re so high up, I can\'t even see the ground anymore!      \n\nThis is amazing!"
"Hey, Anna... these woods are... starting to look a bit different over here. \nIs this normal?"
"Yeah, we\'re getting to the cursed parts. \nI don\'t usually go in this deep, on account of ghosts and voodoo magic. \nBut with all of us together it feels a lot safer."
(My first duty as their prisoner is to be dragged into some cursed forest?! \nPerhaps I was wrong about them - maybe they are skilled at psychological warfare after all!)
This isn\'t the friendly forest area full of slimes and bunnies that I thought it would be!
"This stuff was... not here before, haha."
"(Hmmm, my fortress is just south of here. \nSo this is where all the sewage from my lab ends up? \nI better keep my mouth shut about that!)"
THERE IT IS!!
"I have a feeling this monolith is making all of the monsters more aggressive than usual. \nI mean, it\'s always spooky around here, but it\'s getting worse lately!"
Why are we just standing here?! \nThere\'s zombies over there!
"Hmmm, they look sort of familiar..."
It\'s beautiful in here! \nI didn\'t know such a biome even existed!
"I wonder if these mushrooms are edible... \nIt\'s tempting to try, but I\'ve had bad experiences in the past..."
My allergies are... flaring up.  \nToo much... fungus.
Is he going to die?        \n(Maybe he deserves it.)
"Ahhh, the raft maker lives just west of here, so we\'re almost there. \nIt\'s just that... we still need to find an item that lets us walk on those lily pads."
"There\'s always an obstacle blocking our path in this stupid forest, isn\'t there?! \nAnd now we need to wade through filthy swamp water? Kill me now!"
"Well excuse me, princess! \nMaybe if you spent more time outdoors and trimmed some weight off, you wouldn\'t be having such a hard time! \nDid you even think about that?"
Most people don\'t live in trees or spend their lives foraging in the bushes like savages! \nYou can\'t blame this on me!
"Sure I can! \nYou\'re all flabby and you\'ve got those huge udders swinging around!          \n\nThat\'s the only reason guys are so nice to you, you know!"
Do you think I like the attention I get from perverts?! \nAt least you don\'t have to worry about being kidnapped into sexual slavery!
(Could she still be mad at me about the kidnapping...? \nBut it\'s already been several hours since that happened!)
"Well, whatever, Natalie. \nI don\'t want to make you cry."
I\'m not crying!
"Ahhh, the raft maker lives just west of here, so we\'re almost there. \nIt\'s just that... we still need to find an item that lets us walk on those lily pads."

"Well, whatever, Natalie. \nI don\'t want to make you cry."
I\'m not crying!
"H-hey, Natalie. \nI\'m sorry about earlier."
"Oh, yeah?"
"I don\'t actually think you\'re fat. \nAnd I don\'t think you\'re a cow either.          \n\nYou\'re just a little sheltered, is all I was trying to say."
"I don\'t think you said that, but fair enough.           \n\nI guess you are forgiven now."
Maybe someday we can go camping and I\'ll show you how to survive in the wild! \nWe can hunt and cook some bears or something!
"Haha, that might be fun experience, as long as we still have running water and wifi!"
(She\'s hopeless!)
We\'re almost done! \nThis is the tightest spot - once we crawl through here it\'ll get much easier.
I\'m starting to wonder if an honourable death would have been preferable to this utter humiliation.
Oh that can still be arranged.        \nWe don\'t need complainers around here.
"Nya nya, nya nya!"
"Huh, what are you saying?"
"I\'m not looking, I swear! \nNoLegs is lying!"
Ehhhhhhhhhh?!
"Alright, we\'re equipped to reach every part of the canopy now! \nWe\'re not going to encounter any more dead ends up here."
"Alright, the boots that will let us get to the boss should be in here!"
"These special boots were at your house all along, you little brat?! \nWe went through all that danger in the forest because of you?"
"Chill, bro. \nI don\'t think we can blame Anna for the maze-like level design around here."
"What\'s \""level design\""? \nI simply don\'t appreciate being disrespected like that!"
"Oh, what\'s this? \nAre you scared of a little walk through the woods?         \n\nHehehe."
"I can still burn these woods down, you know! \nHow would you like that, you green-haired punk?!"
"Watch that mouth of yours, Lance. \nAny more threats like that and we\'ll have to put you down."
Hmph.
Anyyyway... we can head to the west end of the woods now. \nI think it\'s boss time.
Is that big thing over there the boss? \nWhat even is that?
It doesn\'t seem to be very mobile - let\'s carefully go take a look.
"Yeah, we did it! \nThe rest of those cats are on the run now!"
Those filthy beasts made a huge mistake when they stood in our way! \nThey were mere cannon fodder before our combined might!
Was that it though? \nWas this really the cause of those undead monsters appearing in the forest? \nI think we might be missing part of the story here.
Maybe. \nBut how about giving us a moment to celebrate our victory first?
"Oh, sorry. \nI didn\'t mean it that way. \nWe did good out there."
You all conduct yourselves very well in battle. \nMaybe soon I will be ready to call you my comrades.
"I\'m already ready to call you my bro, bro."
"I guess Lance is starting to pay off his debt of good deeds. \nHe\'s got a lot of work to do, but maybe he\'ll get there eventually."
But he still hasn\'t apologised for anything he\'s ever done wrong!
I won\'t apologise - I did what I believed to be right with the limited information I had at the time. \nMy intentions were always for the betterment of mankind.
We\'ve obviously still got some rehabilitation work to do...
It feels good to be back at sea. \nWe\'re finally free to sail the open waters and go wherever we want!
I\'ve never been out sailing before...      \n...and I\'ve heard horrible stories about giant sea monsters pulling boats down under with their lanky tentacles.
"By the way, how do you control this thing, Matt? \nThere doesn\'t even seem to be any steering mechanism!            \n\nI\'m not exactly filled with confidence..."
"Hehe, sailing a raft is just like walking. \nYou think of moving forward, and it just happens!         \n\nI spent most of my childhood on a raft - my parents took me all around the world!"
"Unfortunately I was too young to remember most of it, so I didn\'t gain any experience. \nAnd they also decided to ditch me on an island when things got too dangerous, haha. \nI had to figure out everything on my own, so maybe that\'s why I\'m a bit slow sometimes."
"So Matt, do you think your parents are still out there somewhere? \nAre they pirates or what?"
"□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Well, uh... sailors don\'t usually live very long. \nSo I\'m not optimistic.         \n\nBut I\'ve accepted that a long time ago."
"I\'m sure they\'d be proud of you now, sailing off on your adventure with a bunch of cuties."
*burp!*
"Haha, I hope so."
Aaaahhhhhhhh.
"NoLegs... are you... fishing? \nFish aren\'t just going to jump into your open mouth, you know!"
Question! \nCan NoLegs swim? \nWe didn\'t ask him before we took off...
!!!
"Oh snap, NoLegs is doomed if he falls off the raft! \nI don\'t think any of us even considered that."
Meow...
"It\'s another monolith. \nIf there\'s monsters, there\'s ALWAYS one of these nearby..."
"That hollowed area in the stone looks like some sort of antenna or focal lens. \nThey\'ve gotta be spying on us, there\'s no other explanation."
There\'s nowhere to land on the southern shore! \nIt\'s all just jagged rocks - what a pain!
"If I remember correctly, the valley south of my house will be the only area where we can safely land on the southern continent. \nBut it\'s... going to be very cold down there."
"Hey, ladies. \nEr, Natalie and Anna I mean."
Yeah?
Am I a lady now?
"I\'d like to... uh... how do I say this...?      \n\nWell, uh..."
Yeaaaahhhh?
I\'d like to a-apo-apologise for my crimes! \nI\'d like to c-cease hostile activities between us!        \n\nI want us to build h-healthy r-relations!
A late apology is better than none I suppose. \nI appreciate the effort.
"I don\'t hold grudges, but I won\'t forget what you did either. \nIf you cross me again you\'ll die the death of a thousand rats!"
(I think it\'s working... \nIs this what they call... forgiveness?)
Meow!
"Yeah, what about us? \nYou sucker-punched us WITH A WHOLE TANK!!        \n\nIt took me minutes to heal all that damage!"
"Pffft, you\'re not getting my sympathy. \nI can admit when I\'ve gone too far, but running over trespassers is fair game."
"Well, I want to forgive you anyway!"
You can\'t forgive me - I haven\'t wronged you!
"Man, this temple is ancient. \nLooks like the jungle\'s reclaiming it."
Has this place already been looted? \nThose pedestals should have shiny things on them!
Hmmmm... maybe this is...? 
"Nope, I\'ve got nothing."
"Woah, I\'ve never seen ruins like these before!"
"History textbooks show many temples built for ancient deities, such as Godcat or Akron, but these are unlike any of those. \nThe face sculptures on these ruins don\'t look like any Gods I\'ve ever heard of."
"The meteor impact has likely caused a global-warming effect. \nEven a difference of a few degrees would have caused a huge portion of the world\'s ice caps to melt. \nMan-made global warming may be a myth, but a meteor impact could definitely do it."
"Is it possible that these ruins lay undiscovered for thousands of years, deep under the ice? \nWe might be some of the first people to ever see them! \nMaybe I should start taking notes..."
That means there must be buried loot around too!
Is it too much to ask for some lore and back-story behind the places we visit?! \nYou simpletons only care about your selfish desires!
What if... space aliens made this?!
*sigh*
So much for exploring new lands - there\'s already NPCs here! \nThey\'ve probably found a lot of the treasure and taken it hostage!
"Well, we still have to travel through here to get to the next town. \nIt\'s called Redpine, I think."
"Yeah, Redpine Town was settled around the same time as Greenwood. \nThere\'s been a lot of rivalry over fishing rights.         \n\nGreenwood is always in the right, obviously!"
I wonder how Redpine Town is holding up after the Great Impact. \nThe north hasn\'t heard much news from down there...
I\'d like to point out the elephant in the room - the town has most likely been totally obliterated.
Lance!
What?
"This architecture is amazing, and so well-preserved. \nThese temples must have been very impressive back in their day!"
Only aliens could have built this - I\'m calling it now!      \nThousands of years ago the people who lived here must have been influenced by extra-terrestrial forces...
"That\'s possible, but not likely. \nAn organized civilization with many slaves could have easily constructed something like this. \nPerhaps they built these to honor their glorious leader. \n(Which could have been a man much like me!)"
Maybe some travellers were cold and just wanted to build a house?
Nya nya...
"You also don\'t buy any of those explanations, NoLegs? \nThey\'re not too bright, are they?"
"Eh, what makes you an expert on ancient history?!       \nHow can you say for sure it wasn\'t aliens or communists?!"
"I\'ll have you know I was a straight-A student at University, and history was one of my favourite subjects! \nI learned all about the forgotten kingdom of cats, the history of the major provinces, the theories of dark and light magics, and about many popular myths and legends. \nYou can learn a lot from reading, you know!"
"If you\'re so smart, how did you end up on a dangerous scouting mission then? \nAnd not in some comfortable academic role?"
"Well, uh...    I don\'t want to talk about it...               \n\n(I left after an embarrassing incident...)"
ALL THIS ICE IS REALLY ANNOYING ME!! \nWhy can\'t we just buy some shoes to help us walk on it?!
"It\'s arranged so specifically, almost as if the nature spirits were mocking us!"
"Nope, nothing of interest this way - just stupid blocks of ice! \nLet\'s go back."
I\'m not dressed appropriately for this weather. \nLet\'s return to my fortress and come back with flamethrowers.
(Why do I still feel like I\'m babysitting a bunch of children?!)
"I really want to figure out what sort of God these ancient people worshipped, and what happened to their civilisation. \nWe\'re finding all these ruins that historians have never seen before, and they\'re raising so many exciting questions."
"Maybe they were just doped-up narcissists, and they made sculptures of themselves with exaggerated foreheads and a third eye!"
"These stone faces... they look kinda like space aliens, don\'t they? \nMaybe these people worshipped aliens, and then they were all abducted by UFOs! \nAnd then the aliens modified all the history books, and that\'s why no one knows about them!?"
"Clearly this was a totalitarian surveillance state. \nThe giant eye of Big Brother watched over the citizens to make sure they were not guilty of wrong-think. \nDo as the eye says, or it\'s rats to the face!"
"Meow, meow!"
"No, I don\'t think they were ear-less cat-men, NoLegs."
"Come on, guys, I\'m trying to think seriously here..."
"Oh yeah, we didn\'t hear the rest of your story from earlier, Natalie. \nSo... what was the reason you left university and ended up out here with us peasants?"
I\'d rather forget about it...
(I\'m not a peasant!)
It wasn\'t anything exciting...              \nI got caught writing smutty fan-fiction involving a member of staff... a lecturer of mine actually.
"AHAHAHAHA, are you serious? \nTHAT\'S the reason?!"
Yeahhh... it was a bit silly... \nI couldn\'t face my class - or the man involved - after that... 
(I can\'t breathe - that\'s too stupid to be true... I\'m going to die from laughter...)
"(Hmm, I wonder what sort of men Natalie is interested in - maybe I should be taking notes here...)"
"Maybe someday I\'ll get over the shame and go finish the course...        \nBut overall I\'m enjoying my time off, and I think I\'m learning more out here anyway.                 \n\nYou can laugh if you want, I don\'t even care."
Nyehehehehe!
(And obviously I\'ve learned my lesson - so now I hide my fan-fiction where no one will ever find it...)
(Did she give me a funny look just now?)
"Ah, it\'s finally getting warmer again! \nGoodbye, Frozen Valley - you won\'t be missed!"
I\'m afraid there\'s a huge rock monster blocking our exit. \nNo sign of Poseidon though - maybe he\'s away on vacation.
"Ohhh boy, we\'re really stacking up some bad karma. \nThe earth won\'t appreciate us beating up nature Gods like that."
"Pffft, nonsense. \nThe earth exists only to have its resources exploited by humankind. \nIt says so right there in the holy Book of Catus. \n(That\'s the only part I\'ve read though...)"
"Anyway, I\'m sure the people of Redpine Town will be glad to hear that we subdued Poseidon. \nThey\'ve probably not heard much news from the outside world lately."
We\'re actually getting really close to our goal now. \nThe site of the Great Impact should be just beyond the town...
"□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□That is, if the town\'s still standing."
*sigh*
"*knocked out, but still twitching*"
I think we can expect a heroes\' welcome when we get to the town! \nWe can finally treat ourselves to some excellent grub!
I don\'t see any people around though...
It\'s... been a while since I\'ve last visited this town.    \nStill looks as bleak as it ever did.
So you know Redpine? \nThey used to have a lot of mines around here - is this where your family is from?
This ugly steroid shop used to be an orphanage. I may have been stuck there for a while after my father exploded.      \n\nIt\'s probably where my hatred of humanity began to grow...         \n...I didn\'t like this town at all.
We still gotta save it though... Redpine and Greenwood are allies despite their differences!
"Bah, it\'s not worth saving. \nThere\'s more corpses buried in this town than there are people still living."
Who hurt you so bad?
"Well, actually, I do like the gun store. \nThat\'s where I first learned to shoot!          \n\nI hunted bears in the woods with--"
..................
"Hmm, I guess my dad did one thing right.                     \n\nWhatever!"
"It\'s eerily quiet around here. \nIs everyone hiding, or...?"
"Oh, it\'s a straggler! \nI don\'t think he recieved the news of my defeat."
We would have reached this town so much sooner if someone didn\'t put these stupid blocks along the shore!
"Oh, so this is where everyone\'s been hiding. \nThey look... rather depressed."
What did we just walk into here... is this some sort of cult?
Now let\'s not be rude or jump to conclusions. \nLet\'s have a look around and see what we can learn from these nice people.
I see they\'ve already looted a lot of treasure from the Frozen Valley ruins!
Now we\'re talking. \nLook at all of these beauties!
Guns would be much cooler if you could attach a massive sword to the end. \nImagine shooting and stabbing a foe at the same time!
That would be a terrible idea. \n(You\'d get blood and guts splashing right into your face!)
This whole town\'s got a spooky vibe. \nIt\'s not even Autumn and all the trees are red! \nThat\'s not normal.
It also smells like a farm!
There\'s a lot of weirdos around here!
Keep your voice down! \nWe actually want to work with these people and not get kicked out!
A lot of these graves look very recent. \nAre the monsters getting so many people?
We\'re next.
"Wow, someone\'s more miserable than usual..."
"It looks like this town\'s seen better days. \nTheir buildings are crumbling and there\'s monsters everywhere. \nWe should do whatever we can to help, since this is our last pit-stop before we arrive at our destination."
"I agree with you, Natz. \nThe more allies we have the better. \nAnd they really need our help around here."
I suppose we might be rewarded for our work... \nIf it involves beating up foes then I\'m all for it.
"Hmmm, I wonder what\'s in there? \nCan we break in somehow?"
It\'s probably just a pile of fresh corpses.
*piercing stare*
What? \nThey need to keep them somewhere until they\'re buried. \nI\'ve seen what happens in war-torn regions!
(I\'m not sure if I even want to find out what\'s down here...)
(I can hear something breathing up ahead!)
What the hell was going on back there?! \nThat was just a bit too real.
"Oh, a secret cavern? \nThere\'s no way anything innocent is happening down here..."
Is this... b-blood? \nI knew that guy was hiding something!
Is there someone we should call about that? \nLike the police or something?
"The police is probably busy arresting people for making offensive jokes online, or something trivial like that."
"Nah, there ain\'t no such thing as police around here. \nSo I guess it\'s none of our business.          \n\nI\'m just going to avoid this house in future."
"Wow, we can\'t see a thing!           \n\nHmm, can you see anything with your night vision, NoLegs?"
"Nyayaya, nya!"
You think this is a torture chamber?!
Aha! \nA secret passage in the walls!
It\'s all slimy back here... and I can hear something crawling around.
(Maybe a horror movie scenario where only me and Natalie survive wouldn\'t be so bad. \nAnything could happen down here... some of us might take a little tumble off a cliff...)
"(Nah, I shouldn\'t think that way anymore!)"
...
(Huh? Is the cat reading my mind or something?)
Let\'s never go back in there.
We can agree on that.
It was just a bunch of dudes in masks though. \nNothing to freak out over.
BUT WHY WERE THEY IN MASKS?! \nWhat were they doing in there with all those skulls?!
Maybe they were just having some sort of larping session! \nSome people like to dress up and pretend to be weird stuff!
W-what the... this is... a whole landscape full of black rock?
There\'s a flying monolith over there! \nWhy the hell is it floating like that?!         \n\nIs it in attack mode or something?
At least we know where that meteor landed. \nThere\'s no more doubt about that - this is our final destination. \nWe\'ve come a long way to get here!
"I guess we\'re finally gonna find out what these monoliths are up to, and what\'s really going on around here. \nI\'m definitely a bit nervous now..."
"We\'re super far away from home now. \nNatalie really dragged us along on a huge adventure, huh NoLegs?"
Meow...
"Well I\'m extremely glad I didn\'t come here alone, that\'s for sure! \nWe\'ll be alright, NoLegs."
Meow?
"Yeah, really."
"If I survive this and make it home, I\'ll sure have a lot of stories to tell. \nAll I was trying to do was get my electricity back on, and I got dragged into this big adventure. \nI\'ve levelled up so much that my old friends won\'t even recognise me!"
"I might have been a bit naive at first - I figured we\'d rent a raft in Hope Harbor and get here in no time at all. \nBut a lot of dangerous stuff happened along the way, and maybe some of that was my fault..."
"None of us are here just because of you, Natz. \nWe\'ve all got things we need to protect, and we\'ve all made some mistakes along the way. \nBut that\'s okay."
Meow!
I wonder what the folks back home would say if they could see this place. \nThey\'d probably chain me down and never let me leave again.
I was expecting to find a huge crater with a few monoliths around. \nBut this looks like we\'re on a totally different planet...
There\'s something cold and sticky dripping on me... \nLet\'s hurry up and find that light switch.
"Ewww, I stepped on something squishy... and the walls sound like they\'re breathing."
Meow!     \n\nNya!
"NoLegs says he\'ll be fine in the dark, but the rest of us are probably doomed...         \n\nThat\'s not good."
"If you abandon us in the dark, NoLegs, we might shoot you by accident!"
Myeh...
"Nope. I\'m not helping with this part. \nYou can take care of this, Natz."
Well that\'s nothing new.
"These teleport devices are incredible! \nWe\'re being disassembled at an atomic scale, and reassembled at a new location."
That sounds like it should be very painful. \nBut it just feels a bit like falling asleep for a second.
The question is... are we dying and then being cloned each time we go through a teleporter?
What would that imply?
Probably nothing.
This lake of lava must be the exact spot where the meteor landed. \n
Good thing the lava cushioned the impact then!
"No, that\'s not how physics works. \nThe impact melted this whole area. \nHundreds of NPCs must have been obliterated instantly. "
"Woah, think of all the treasure chests that would have been destroyed too.           \n\nLife is too cruel."
"Wow, it\'s that temple we saw earlier. \nIt doesn\'t look like a temple of Godcat though. \nMaybe this is where those Godless cultists worship."
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□I see several paths we can take here. \nThis whole area looks like a sprawling labyrinth. 
What an oddly specific arrangement of stones. \nIt looks like some round objects used to sit here in these pedestals.
"(Hey, you. Yeah, YOU. \nIt\'s been a while since we\'ve spoken, because it\'s awkward when the others are around. \nYou can still read this when I\'m just thinking it, right? \nAm I praying? Hmm, maybe.)"
"(Anyway, I know that you\'ve got a big part to play in this, even if I don\'t know exactly what that is. \nIt was all fun and games in the beginning when it was just me and you and NoLegs. \nBut things are getting serious now, and you better look after my friends. \nEspecially Natalie - I think she would blame herself if anything bad happened to us.)"
"(So if you have as much influence over our fate as I think you do, please make sure we don\'t die.         \n\nAlso, please don\'t skip optional areas - I want to get all the loot that I can!)"
"Why are you spacing out over there, Matt? \nWe\'re deep into foe territory now - we need you to focus!"
S-sorry!
We\'ve got 2 of the orbs now! \nWe\'re making progress here.
Meow!
"Alright, that\'s us collected 3 of the orbs now. \nThe suspense is killing me!"
"I have a feeling that we\'re going to be raptured soon, so I\'m just enjoying my last hours on earth."
Meow?
I\'m a bit nervous about this. \nThere\'s no way of knowing what\'s gonna happen when we put all 4 orbs in place...
The best and worst case scenario is that the final boss gets summoned and we all die.
Well just in case anything happens... \nIt was nice knowing ya\'ll!
(Suddenly they start taking things seriously. \nMaybe it was better for morale when they didn\'t.)
ACK! MY STUFF!!
"Woah, what\'s happening?!"
Looks like we\'re blasting off again!
"Woohoo, this is fun! \nThere\'s no gravity here!"
We\'re being sucked through an interdimensional wormhole. \nThere\'s no telling where we will end up. \nIt could even be on the other side of the galaxy.
"It\'s okay - I blindly trust this strange alien portal! \nThere\'s a light up ahead, I think we\'re almost there...!"
W-WE\'RE IN SPACE?! \nAre we going to suffocate?!
"Woah, we\'re really high up! \nIs that what the earth looks like from so far away? \nI can breathe just fine though... why would we suffocate?"
"This... is not normal. \nIs this real life, or just fantasy?          \n\nThe laws of the universe shouldn\'t allow such a place to exist!"
Is this... a pocket universe? \nAn area of space-time separated from our world by dimensional barriers? \nDid the monoliths create this?
"THEIR CONTROLLER MUST BE HERE!! \nWhatever\'s been commanding the monoliths, this would the best place for it to hide itself!"
I didn\'t understand much of that. \nBut whatever has that sort of power is not going to let us kill it easily...
"Meow, meow!"
"Agreed, we should stay confident and get ready for whatever challenges await us here."
"Hold on, there\'s something I\'d like to address for a second. \nSomeone\'s been secretly following us for a very long time..."
W-what?! \nWho\'s been following us?!        \n\nWe\'ve been... somewhat careful!
"I\'ve seen Matt talking to them, so he must be aware of it too. \nThere\'s someone watching us from the sky... or from somewhere beyond.            \n\nI can\'t explain it, but I can feel it."
"You can feel it too, Natz? \nI thought maybe I was a little bit crazy. \nI\'ve always thought of them as the player controlling a game world. \nThat\'s how I explained it to myself, anyway."
"There\'s many great minds that believe the world we live in just a simulation, but I don\'t know if there\'s enough evidence to support such a claim yet. \nThere may never even be a way to prove something like that."
"It\'s not so much that I know the truth - I just have this gut feeling.       \n\nI talk to myself sometimes just in case someone might be listening. \nGood things seem to happen to me when I explain my thoughts out loud, as if someone\'s is listening to me and guiding me."
"Plus, there\'s all these little user interface elements floating around. \nIcons and speech bubbles and stuff like that. \nWe don\'t need those, we can talk to each other without them. \nThey\'ve gotta be there for someone else who\'s watching us from far away!"
(How did I not notice this speech box before? \nIt\'s so obvious now that I know what to look for!)
"Well, anyway. \nI\'d like to say something to that player behind the screen, or whoever that person is. \nI think they know us well enough so that we can be honest with them..."
YOU BETTER LOOK AFTER US AND MAKE SURE WE DON\'T DIE HERE!!
"We\'ve come a long way and it\'s getting REALLY dangerous now, and you\'ve not always made the best decisions for us. \nThere were times when I thought we wouldn\'t make it, because we were being guided in the wrong direction. \nSo if this is the end of our adventure, you better take it seriously!"
"Hey, Natz, we don\'t want to make them angry or anyth-"
"If you let any of my friends get hurt, you\'ll have to deal with me!"
"Alright, I\'m done. \nI hope that message actually reached someone."
I\'m very confused here. \nI didn\'t know Matt and Natz were so religious!
*smiles as if he knew about this all along*
Stop! \nWe can\'t go this way... something\'s very wrong over there.
I feel like my body is being pulled forward against my will! \nI don\'t want to go this way anymore!
M-meow!
WHAT THE-
...
M-mew...
"Space itself is being cracked and twisted beyond recognition! \nIf this corruption spreads, the fabric of all space and time could disintegrate into nothingness.        \n\nIt\'s as if the world itself is being deleted and shredded."
What are we even supposed to do here? \nIs this the end?! \nHow do we fight something like this?
"I could have stayed home and lived a little longer in blissful ignorance. \nLet\'s go back and do that, guys!       \n\nI don\'t want to be swallowed by the void!"
M-m-m-meow...
It\'s all just a nightmare. \nIt\'s all just a nightmare. \nIt\'s all just a nightmare. \nIt\'s all just-
HEY!! \nSnap out of it!
"We\'ve come so far together, and we\'ll pull through if we do our best. \nEach one of us is as powerful as any foe we\'ve encountered so far! \nThat person behind the screen is going to guide us to victory, I can feel it!"
"We\'re not alone in this fight either - we\'ve got a huge supporting cast of creatures to back us up! \nAnd there\'s tons of people back in Hope Harbor, Greenwood Village and Redpine Town all rooting for us! \nWe can\'t let them down!"
"If this is our final battle, I\'m going to make it count! \nBut I\'d be lying if I said I wasn\'t terrified!"
"Mom and dad would never forgive me if I lost here! \nI have to win for them, and for everyone else!"
"I-I- If I\'m going to go down, I\'ll make it as painful for our enemy as possible! \nI\'ll detonate every bomb I\'ve got left!"
"It\'s been fun travelling with you all, and it would be nice if we could keep doing it.             \n\nI suppose... I\'ll try... hitting it with my sword. \nThat seems to have worked so far."
Meow!
"And thus, Earth was finally free from the manipulative tentacles of the Devourer. Their mission failed - and without further commands - the Cosmic Monoliths were deactivated. As their dangerous radiation faded away, beasts and humans could finally relax again, and wars that had been waging for entire days finally ended."
"The party began to regain memories of their previous adventures - years of experience and friendship gradually returned to them. With the Devourer no longer controlling the Void, deleted information was slowly being restored from the cosmic recycle bin. The memories of terminated simulations flooded back in dreams and divinations."
"Matt and NoLegs would continue plundering dungeons for treasure, while gradually stealing less from innocent NPCs. Natalie\'s harsh judgements had lead them towards more ethical missions. She could see that Matt was beginning to take things more seriously, and Matt did his best to not let her down, despite a few setbacks."
"With the world at peace, they finally had some time to spend alone together - just like in the beginning of their epic quest. Natalie would have liked to settle down somewhere to live a peaceful life, but she figured Matt still needed a few years to grow up. So until then, they continued on smaller adventures together, before eventually coming out as an official couple."
"Lance seemingly developed a conscience, and began rebuilding the homes he had destroyed. He reprogrammed his robots to automatically fetch materials and assemble them into structures. Foes which were made of stone or wood often became collateral damage, and many gardens were also destroyed. A risk assessment was never carried out."
"But Lance\'s secret goal was to remain close to Natalie, and doing charity work seemed to be the best way. Even he could tell that she would probably never be romantically interested in him, but until someone better came along, a tiny chance was fine. Maybe she would come to her senses eventually, he thought. Maybe Matt would be slain in battle. It\'s a bit of a stretch, but it\'s nice to dream."
"Anna\'s parents decided that if she was old enough to save the world, she was also old enough to move out of their house. And thus, they kicked her out. Anna bought a small patch of land with a modest house sitting on it, and quickly filled it to the brim with plants and pots. The house became damp and mouldy, and infested with caterpillars. Anna\'s health suffered."
"Once Natalie finished university, she moved in with Anna so that she could perform an intervention. Natalie enforced a minimal level of cleanliness and organisation, and suggested that they start a garden centre, which would allow Anna to persue her hobbies without becoming a hoarder. NoLegs functioned as their mascot, and the business went on to be very popular among local hippies and grannies."
"Matt and Anna grew up playing video games on completely different consoles, so now they\'re catching up on all of the games they\'ve missed. In particular, they\'re both big fans of action and adventure games, especially if a co-op mode is available. Fighting games would often result in real life fights and smashed controllers though."
"Until recently, they were both too poor to afford the internet, or any official strategy guides. Now, with some hints available, they\'re finally revisiting many old games to find the secrets they\'ve missed before. They\'re also tempted to try out this new thing called \""online gaming\"" - but so far technical problems have prevented them from hooking their consoles up."
"Lance and Anna would go on to share many hunting trips together. They would responsibly hunt troublesome pests, such as slimes and penguins, which would often harass the livestock of small towns. Occasionally, they would even receive an exciting bounty on a rare and challenging beast, such as an adamantoise or a behemoth king."
"Anna\'s respect for the natural world and Lance\'s expertise of modern firearms meant that they had much to learn from each other - most importantly that destruction and conservation are vitally linked in a continuous cycle. Lance came to understand that carpet bombing was an unsustainable hobby, and Anna would learn many new swear words."
"In preparation for any future alien invasions, Matt and Lance researched new weapons. They managed to build the \""Giga Sword Cannon 9000+\"", which is capable of penetrating 20 tanks lined up in a column. Other concepts included gunblades, sword-chucks, and remote-controlled swords. Lance shot down all of these ideas, because - in his words - they were idiotic."
"Lance\'s dream of world domination remained alive, but he would continue to pursue it through peaceful means. With the resources and technology he had amassed, he would kick start an industrial revolution, positioning himself as a market leader in an emerging capitalist system. Apparently it\'s more profitable to sell goods than to destroy them."
"The Epic Battle Fantasy team had completed their obligation to save the world, and more or less went their seperate ways. They never overcame their differences, and were left holding grudges. They would meet up from time to time to have a beer, and to reminisce about their great adventure. But never again would they achieve something so great."
Hey! \nThat ending was a bit of a downer!
"I know, right? \nWere we really such a bad team?"
"Well some of us just sat on the bench for most of the adventure and didn\'t even get a chance to shine. \nI\'m not referring to anyone in particular, but just saying."
"Hmmm, maybe if we completed more quests, or tried to involve everyone in battle, we\'d get a better ending...?"
What a cynical plot device! \nWe can\'t have a happy ending unless we do more chores?
At least the full ending isn\'t DLC.
Meow...
"The Epic Battle Fantasy team had saved the world and earned the respect of many. They gathered a strong following of fans, but some people still condemned their reckless actions along the way. They were seen as dependable heroes in times of trouble, but in peaceful times they were a nuisance."
"Woop, we did it! \nWe got a kind of decent ending!"
I don\'t think that\'s all of it though - we didn\'t see everyone\'s story conclude. \nThere must be a bit more to it than that.
It looks like we also made some enemies... \nI guess that\'s what happens when you jerks keep stealing stuff!
"Yeah... we\'ve got some apologising to do, at the very least. \nIt\'ll probably take a lot more than that for everyone to forgive us."
"Well, I\'m perfectly happy to keep playing if ya\'ll are. \nThere\'s still secrets left for us to find!"
Hold on! \nI\'ve just recieved a telepathic message from the developer!
"He says that to get the full ending, you have to get lots of achievements, and use all of us in battle together! \nWe gotta strengthen our bonds of friendship! \nAnd we should also talk to that Bard guy in the warp zone!"
That sounds exponentially lame. \nAre we in some sort of kids\' cartoon?
Meow!
"The Epic Battle Fantasy team had not only saved the world, but also worked hard to undo most of the damage they had caused along the way. They rebuilt villages, paid off their debts, and donated their captured monsters to local preservation projects. They had statues built in their honour, and remained good friends for many years to come."
"So uh, are me and Matt like, dating now? \nThis is all a bit sudden!"
"No we\'re not, not yet anyway! \nAll of that stuff will happen in the future!"
It\'s a bit weird seeing what\'s going to happen to us. \nDoesn\'t that violate some sort of time travel rules?
I\'m sure we\'ll find a way to mess everything up before it happens. \nThere\'s still plenty of time for that!
So this is the best possible ending? \nBah!             \n\nI\'m not interested...
"I don\'t think anyone would enjoy your preferred ending, Lance. \nI really hope you turn out more like that future Lance we just saw."
I\'ll need to program my own video game someday - one where I\'m the main character and I always win! \n(That\'ll show \'em!)
Excuse me while I go shoot some penguins.
"Hey, that sounds like fun! \nLet\'s get \'em back for what they did to NoLegs!"
"Meow, meow!"
"Oh, by the way! I\'m talking to YOU, the player now. \nIf you really liked Epic Battle Fantasy 5, and think it\'s worth more than what you paid for it (maybe you got it in a sale?), please consider throwing some bucks at the developer to support updates and future games! Any amount of support on Patreon will get you some cool perks, and you can also follow news at the links above!"
"Oh, by the way! I\'m talking to YOU, the player now. \nCorrect me if I\'m wrong, but I think you\'re playing the free version of Epic Battle Fantasy 5 right now. If you want a bunch of extra content, then I really think you should buy the Deluxe Version of the game! You can even transfer your save data with the file backup feature!"
"Hey, stop shilling! \nPeople don\'t take kindly to that sort of thing. \nAnyone playing this is probably going to delete us now."
"Hmmm, oh well. It was a fun ride while it lasted.  \nBig thanks for playing! \nWe wouldn\'t have made it all the way to game 5 if it wasn\'t for the huge support of our fans!"
What about the thing?          \n\nYou know... that SECRET thing!
"Oh yeah... I think it\'s called \""New Game+\"".            \nWe can play through the game again, but we get to keep all of our equips and stats! \nOh, and achievements that have to be done on Epic difficulty can\'t be unlocked on this mode..."
But what if we still have unfinished business in the current saved game?
"Gotta quit and load the game again, I guess. \nFor some reason we can\'t save after beating the final boss."
Oh... \nSo uh... what about New Game+? \nDo we need to do something to start it? \nOr is it just going to-
Ice and magma... in the same cavern? \nWhat sort of trickery is this?
"Meow, meow - meow!"
Huh? \nYou can smell another cyclops in here? \nLooks like we still have work to do then!
W-what\'s with these puzzles? \nI think it\'s best if we just walk past this one.
More puzzles... please don\'t do this to me. \nWhy can\'t I just fight my way through these blocks?
Meow... meow!
"Haha... you want me to carry you across? \nCome on, NoLegs, you can manage. \nDon\'t be a scaredy cat!"
...
"Alright, there\'s two bosses here - I\'m sure they\'re going to attack us together though. \nWe\'ve got some options here-"
"Oh, I get it! \nWe can fight them on either the ice side or the fire side, right, Natz?!"
"Yeah, that\'s right!"
Well that takes care of that!
"But I never knew a cavern like this existed so close to my house. \nIt\'s kinda cool and scary at the same time. \nHmmm, I wonder if there\'s more optional dungeons like this one..."
There\'s gotta be tons of them around the world! \nAnd they\'ve gotta contain more treasure!
"It\'s been weeks since I last came down here. \nThis is where my robots dig for metal ore and fossil fuels - they\'ve made a lot of progress, I see."
How far do these tunnels go? \nAre there monsters in here? \nAny treasuse?
"Hmmm, I have no idea. \nA lot of the machines have either rusted away or gone rogue. \nMaybe we\'ll run into some of them, or maybe not."
These tunnels just keep going on forever! \nIs it even possible to explore them all?
Well if the round-earth theory is correct - which I believe it is - then these tunnels would loop around the earth and back to the beginning eventually. \nWhether they actually go that far... I have no idea. \nThe robots were not programmed to write a comprehensive status report.
"Hey, I don\'t know if this applies to all robots - but if there\'s a big mechanical boss in here, maybe we can follow its tracks through the tunnels? \nMaybe those could lead us to it?"
"That is a good point - perhaps you are brighter than you look. \nIf we find tank tracks, we can follow them!"
"Gee, thanks.       \n\nI probably don\'t need to mention my second idea, but drawing a map might also help us keep track of where we\'ve been."
I\'m getting real queasy from this stuffy air - why does it smell so bad?
"It\'s just petrol, sulfur and smoke. \nIs that all it takes to defeat you?"
I can\'t breathe.
It feels like we\'ve been walking in circles for hours. \nCan we at least set up camp and rest for a while?
"I think that security guard said that we\'ll wind up at the entrance if we take a break. \nWe better keep going if we want to find the end, Natz."
Uguu...
"If memory serves me right, there should be a total of two puzzle rooms like this one. \nThese are the power stations for the whole tunnel system."
What\'s this? \nA hidden room?
I\'d rather be lost in the tunnels than stuck in a puzzle room. \nLet\'s go back.
"Woah, there\'s huge spikes coming out of the ground! \nThe whole room is rumbling - is that the boss?!"
"If we\'re going to fight it, we have to hit it with as much force as we can. \nIt\'s insanely resistant to damage, so we cannot hold back, or we\'ll definitely be killed."
"Being buried alive is not a pleasant way to go. \nSo if it comes to that, I\'ll end myself well in advance."
"Why do I feel like we\'re still cleaning up your mess, even now that you\'re presumably on our side? \nAnd now\'s not the time to freak out, you need to help us with this boss!"
"I\'m starting to understand the drawback of nuclear fusion engines - they never run out of fuel, so any machines equipped with them need not be dependant on their masters. \nPerhaps planned obsolescence has its place as a safety mechanism."
How about you don\'t arm mining machines with huge missiles in the first place?!
"Nonsense. \nThey need to by able to protect themselves from eco-terrorists. \nYou\'d never believe it, but some people object to having these tunnels dug under their homes."
"Well if we\'re done exploring, I\'d gladly like to return to the surface now."
"A cave full of zombies, huh? \nCall it a hunch, but this might have something to do with the cursed forest."
"Wow, I never knew this place existed. \nI\'m not much of spelunker."
"Caves are very dangerous. \nYou need to keep an eye out for hidden lava flows, and all sorts of creepers.        \n\nThere could also be gas leaks, so you want to think carefully before lighting a match."
EEEEEE!! \nI almost slipped!
"Watch your step, Natz. \nIt\'s a long drop!"
"Oh, of course, block puzzles. \nThere\'s always gotta be block puzzles, even the zombies have to make them!"
Truly this is hell.
"It looks like a primitive password system. \nWe could brute force it with enough time, I\'m sure."
I don\'t think there\'s any need for that. \nWe just have to figure out what these symbols mean.
Is no one going to comment on what we did to get down here? \nWhy was poop the key?
I\'ve seen worse. \nAt least it wasn\'t the still beating hearts of kittens.
Meow?!
I feel like... we\'re being watched down here.
"(I\'m always watching you, Natalie. \nSo don\'t you worry about that.)"
"Oh, it\'s another cat nest! \nThey\'re persistent little buggers."
I wonder what the diseased little beasts have prepared this time. \nLet\'s go serve them another eviction notice.
"With that cursed tree gone, the Mystic Woods should eventually return to normal.         \n\nI hope."
It looked like those roots could have easily reached the surface. \nI agree with you - this must have been the source of the curse.
"Cats seem to be behind all of the world\'s problems, huh? \nNothing good ever comes from cats."
MEOW!!
"NoLegs says: \""Not all cats, you utter twat!\"""
Tell NoLegs that I\'m not going to exchange insults with an animal - I am far above that.
...
Let\'s just get out of here.
Huh? \nWhy did we have to leave our boots behind?
"Beats me. \nThere\'s probably no reason, I just picked a random item."
What\'s this?       \n\nThese ruins have been preserved so well! \nThis is incredible!
I can see now why we had to leave the boots.
MORE ICE PUZZLES?! \nIt was a trap all along!?
"(Are they... drawing energy from these crystals? \nWas I doing it wrong? \nIt\'s the crystals that I should have been collecting, not the monoliths?)"
"Oh, there\'s a three-headed dragon between us and that huge crystal. \nHmmm, which do I value more, wealth or health?"
This situation is indeed sub-optimal. \nIt would be better if there were no dragon.
That dragon didn\'t stand a chance against us!
"I shall be known as Matt, the legendary dragon slayer, hoarder of crystals, first of his kind!"
"That\'s strange - before the battle started, you were both considering fleeing!"
"They\'ve got a very selective memory, Anna. \nAnd a habit of decieving themselves, too."
Nope. No way. I\'m done.        \n\nNatalie can do it again.
"But Matt, I thought you\'d never leave any treasure chest unopened, no matter the challe-"
DO YOU THINK THIS IS EASY FOR ME?! \nTo give up on my dreams like this?            \n\nIf I could do it I would!
"Relax, we can do it together. \nAnd I\'m sure someone online will be willing to share the solution if we get stuck."
"Look, Matt. \nThere\'s so many crystals here, why don\'t you collect those while we handle the puzzles?"
BECAUSE I ONLY WANT THE THINGS I CAN\'T HAVE!! \nISN\'T THAT OBVIOUS?!
You\'re such a baby!            \n\n(You\'re actually kind of cute when you\'re mad...)
...
It\'s getting really toasty in here.
Not even several feet of rock will stop me from reaching a chest!
"Unless that rock is arranged into a block puzzle, right?"
Why do you mock me?!
"Woah, savage!"
"When you reach the lava, you start wondering if maybe you\'ve dug too deep."
Is that huge golem over there a relation of Poseidon? \nMaybe we shouldn\'t tell him what we did to that guy... haha.
I concur.
"That was a close one. \nWe\'ve really made a lot of powerful enemies, haven\'t we?"
Even the Gods can\'t stop us when we work together! \nLet\'s plunder this place and head for the next treasure trove!
"I guess we were all pretty cool out there, weren\'t we?"
"Meow, meow!"
I think some of my hair\'s been singed off.
"□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Woah, where are we? \nIt looks very strange, but not in a scary sort of way."
We\'ve obviously went through a wormhole and into another dimension. \nIf you look closely at the scenery you can see that there isn\'t any.
It almost looks like the graphics aren\'t finished or something. \nMaybe we\'ve wandered into some area that\'s under construction?
I don\'t see any foes or anything like that. \nNo traps either - but it\'s hard to see through all this darkness.
The laws of physics seem to apply all the same. \nPerhaps there is nothing to be afraid of - let\'s investigate!
I agree!
Meow!
Is that thing over there a citizen of this dimension? \nWhat even is that?
It looks derpy enough to be friendly. \nMaybe it can tell us where we are?
I didn\'t expect that cat-like thing to put up much of a fight. \nEspecially since it looked so... 2-dimensional.
"It\'s a shame we had to beat it up. \nBut we made it out alive, so it\'s all good."
M-meow...?
"Now\'s not the time to get all philosophical on us, NoLegs. \nThat thing may have had a vaguely cat-like form, but I\'m sure it wasn\'t related to you - nor any other life form on this planet!"
"Anyway, I\'m sure I saw some loot back there, so let\'s not forget to grab that too!"
Eh? Is this a secret level?! \nThis is awesome!
But something feels a bit strange here...        \nWhy does a place like this even exist?
Meow...
I think we\'ve wandered somewhere we shouldn\'t have...
"It\'s fine, these are just secret levels!"
(But this area doesn\'t look... intentional. \nI\'m sure we aren\'t supposed to see this!)
"Oh, here we go again! \nThis is the 3rd secret area we\'ve found!"
"It\'s a tad creepy, isn\'t it? \nSecret areas hidden in a different dimension like this? \nSome powerful magic must be behind this..."
"If the simulated universe theory is correct... then this could be a glitch in our simulation.         \n\nThat\'s very bad, because glitched systems typically get rebooted."
Meow?
It\'s another glitched secret level!
That\'s 4 we\'ve found so far... I think!
"(So far these glitches seem to be trivial, with no permanent side effects. \nI wonder if we could glitch into a forbidden memory location? \nWhat would we find there? Could someone else exploit such a flaw?)"
"(On the other hand, it\'s probably better not to know too much about that...)"
LET\'S LEAVE RIGHT NOW!! \nI have a VERY bad feeling about this!
We\'re in total agreement for once. \nLet\'s just leave this place alone forever.
PLEASE HAVE MERCY! \nDon\'t send us over there!
I can\'t do this. I can\'t do this. I can\'t do this. \nI\'m not here. I\'m not here. I\'m not here.
I can\'t breathe. \n(I\'m going to suffocate!)
"Hey, we REALLY don\'t want to do this.          \n\nI know you\'re reading this! \nSo please let us leave, okay?"
Please AT LEAST turn down the difficulty setting? \nYou\'re gonna kill us all!
We won... □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□but we\'re never going to be the same after that. \nYou sent us in there even though we begged you not to.         \n\nYou\'re a monster.
That didn\'t sound like us back there. \nWas that thing... speaking through us?
I\'m going to need a hundred showers and a holiday. \nJust when you think you\'ve seen the worst of it - something like this happens.
I\'m going to cry myself to sleep for the rest of my life.           \n\nI\'ll never recover from this experience...
M-meooowwww...
"(Huh? □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Why\'s the music not turning back to normal?)            \n\nCome on, let\'s get out of here before that THING respawns!"
"We had to jump through a lot of hoops to get in here. \nWhat could possibly require so much secrecy?         \n\nIt just looks like an old temple to me, with, uh..."
"I\'ve got a very bad feeling about this. \nThis isn\'t a temple of Godcat, this place was built for another deity - a much more sinister one..."
I think this is one of Akron\'s temples!
Akron? \nThat name sounds strangely familiar...
"Akron was banished from this plane of existence by Godcat, thousands of years ago. \nHe was an abomination - a twisted, demonic figure, covered in boils, teeth, and tentacles.            \n\nHe absorbed the life energy from his victims, and used it create grotesque homunculi in their likeness."
"Or so the legend goes, anyway - no one knows if any of that even happened. \nThere\'s probably no such thing as a homunculus either."
When has our wishful thinking ever been right though?
"WOAH, WE\'RE IN SPACE AGAIN??"
"Hmm, this looks like some sort of arena. \nI think we should be ready to fight an incredibly powerful foe."
"Well there\'s only one evil version of us that we haven\'t fought yet, and that\'s-"
Meow!
"Oh yeah, we haven\'t fought evil NoLegs yet! \nShould we be worried?"
Well this will probably be quite an easy fight. \n\'Cause what\'s a little cat going to do to us?
Meow...
Did we really beat all of the optional bosses?! \nSo... what\'s all this then?
I guess all that\'s left is some achievement hunting. \nI\'m up for doing these extra challenges if you all want to. \nIt\'s probably just simple stuff like beating all of the bosses in a row... haha.
"I\'m guessing this isn\'t part of the main story anymore. \nSo if we die here, we won\'t die in real life.          \n\nProbably."
"That sounds like a lot of work. \nBut I guess we\'ve beaten them all before, so we can probably do it again."
I\'m always happy to increase my reputation and earn medals - so I\'m in. \nI also think that... we\'re a much more effective combat unit now!
"If we can fight old bosses again, this will be a great chance to capture any foes that we\'ve missed!"
"Hehehe, I knew you\'d get into monster hunting eventually, Natz."
Eh?! \nI guess... my stance has changed a bit lately.
"We did it, I think? \nAre we still going to turn to stone?"
"We must have been uncursed by now, otherwise we\'d be dead."
"Meow, meow!"
"Fine, I\'ll stop \""joking\"" about eating you, NoLegs. \nThings got a bit too real back there."
Well that was thoroughly traumatising. \nI\'m gonna need to look at cat pictures to erase that battle from my mind.
*wants to help*
A-ARE WE STILL ALIVE?! \nI need to know!
"It appears that we\'ve survived that blast, and this temple is somehow still standing too.\nI\'ve encountered explosions like that in the past, but I wasn\'t sure if the rest of you lot would make it."
Self destructing foes are SO cheap.
And that\'s another one for my arsenal!
I don\'t know if I can bear to hunt any foes after that. \nIt makes me feel sick to know that they suffer so much.
Nonsense! \nWild monsters don\'t feel fear or pain!         \n\nYou can\'t let this experience affect you like that.
A-are you sure? \nMany of them scream when they die.
I\'m always sure about everything. \nFoes are merely mindless automata.
"(I feel a lot better, but I\'m still not sure if I should trust Lance on this one.)"
"Woah, did we just have a \""spiritual experience\""?"
My mind is blown - is any of this even real? \nI want to stop seeing cats now or I\'ll blow my brains out!
Meow!
AAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!
My parents always said that the greatest battles we will ever fight are within ourselves. \nIs this what they meant?
"Probably not, but wise words nonetheless."
I think we\'re going to be okay! \nI think we passed the test!
I think so too.          \n\nWe\'re alright.
Nya!
"The power is out, so I\'ll just play on the computer until it comes back on...          \n\nOh."
"It\'s my high-tech gaming console, my most treasured possession!"
"Looks like this bird got what it deserved.             \n\nBirds, man... they\'re always throwing themselves into the side of my house."
"Not sure what this thing is, but it looks like it would eat all of your snacks if it got the chance.          \n\nI guess that problem is taken care of now."
"Oh, it\'s some sort of old games console...          \n...the one I have at home has more bits though!"
It\'s a gun but also a sword...                \nWhatever!
Yup. These fish are very dead...                 \n...and not very fresh either.

What a strange console - it seems to operate on weird frisbees.          \n\nThey look quite scratched too...
"These remind me of a game I used to play. \nIt was supposed to be the final one, but that was a lie.              \n\nI never got past the imps anyway."

This little princess is going to melt soon. \nIt looks like she got lost while wandering through the valley.            \n\nReminds me of a game I played a few years ago.
This creature looks like it could be a powerful ally if tamed...           \nToo bad it\'s just made of snow.
"Here\'s another one of these weird creatures...           \nThis one has some sort of crab claw, so maybe it\'s the water elemental version."
It\'s a face off between two ghosts! \nThey look very realistic!
Not sure if this thing would be a friend or a foe. \nIt\'s got a really goofy looking expression... I\'d feel bad for it and show mercy.
It\'s NoLegs!           \nOr maybe just a non-specific cat in general.

"\""Trying to capture a monster which has surrendered will always be successful, but stronger monsters are much less likely to surrender. Frozen or stunned monsters are very unlikely to evade capture, and other negative status effects also improve chances slightly, with syphon and bad luck being some more notable examples.\"""
"\""When aiming to capture monsters, it helps greatly to be prepared. Some equipment improves a player\'s chances of catching monsters, while other equipment may trigger counter-attacks that will unintentionally kill the monster. The good luck status effect will also improve the player\'s chances.\"""
"\""Positive status effects, defensive buffs, and high HP on a target foe will make it very hard to capture. Debuffing its defence, magic defence, and especially evade, will make it easier to capture. However, offensive buffs or debuffs have no effect on the rate of capture.\"""
"\""When attempting to capture a foe, the chances of success can be seen in how many times the box shakes. Three shakes means it was very close, either way. Less shakes means the outcome was obvious. There is some randomness involved, but it is quite small - relying on luck will usually not be enough to capture a foe.\"""
"\""Foes can surrender in battle if they feel they are going to lose soon. This usually depends on the HP ratio of the two sides - so hurting foes or healing allies can trigger this. Surrendered foes will flee on their next turn, and battle rewards will be earned whether you show mercy or not. Foes may also surrender if all players have the lovable status.\"""
"\""Most foes can be captured - even bosses! \nOnly a few foes cannot be captured - and you\'ll recognize these because you won\'t even be able to target them with the capture skill. If you accidentally slay a foe that you wished to capture, there may be a way to encounter it again later...\"""
"\""When a piece of equipment is upgraded, the chances of random effects activating increases. The exact chances of activation are a mystery, but stronger effects generally activate much less frequently than weaker effects, so balance is preserved. A skilled warrior must gain experience with many equips.\"""
"\""How much time you want to spend preparing for battles is totally your choice. Changing and upgrading equipment regularly, scanning enemies, finding optional treasure, and planning battle strategies will make battles much easier, but will also consume a lot of extra time. Remember that you can change difficulty settings at any time outside of battle.\"""
"\""Remember that some crafting items can be used offensively in battle, and may be useful if your other skills have been disabled in some way. You can also change equipment during combat, and this may be worthwhile in battles with many waves. But it will be harder to compare equipment stats this way.\"""
"\""The Defend command may be useful against bosses and powerful enemies who can charge up a huge attack. Some equipment also gives additional buffs when Defend is used - so if you choose the best effect, it may nullify the enemy attack completely! The Invisible and Enchanted status effects are very powerful if used correctly. Also, some equipment can even turn Defend into an offensive buff!\"""
"\""Never be afraid to run from a battle. A good strategy could be: Entering a battle, scanning the enemies, learning their weaknesses, running away, and then preparing yourself with more effective equipment. There\'s no penalty for doing so, and running always succeeds. There are very few battles where you cannot attempt to flee.\"""
"Bonus skills are those that are learned from NPCs or somehow found in treasure chests. They can be learned by one of several players, and can later be moved to a different player at no cost, without losing any upgrades. This can possibly be exploited. But anyway, remember to think about which player benefits most from each bonus skill, and that each player can only learn 8 of them.\"""
"\""There\'s no way for certain to know the properties of a foe\'s attack, but it\'s usually easy to guess what element it is just by looking at the animation. Whether the attack is physical or magical can also be estimated, depending on whether the foe has hit you with a solid object, or raw energy. This is important when it comes to choosing armor, and deciding which stats to buff and debuff.\"""
"\""Some skills, especially when it comes to enemy attacks, are not 100% elemental. Meaning that the elemental weakness or resistance bonus only applies to a smaller percentage of the total damage. Having 100% resistance to fire, for example, will only block half of the damage from an attack that is 50% fire elemental. On a related note: Weapons that boost elemental damage do not do so for skills that do not have a fixed element, like Normal Attack.\"""
"\""Keep in mind if a skill\'s damage is physical or magical - check the description. All players are more effective with one stat than the other, and equips and buffs enhance them seperately. Most foes have equal defence against both, but some are weaker to one type of damage compared to the other. Bestiary info will show you this.\"""
"\""Some foes may exhibit intelligent behaviour - always check if this is mentioned in their bestiary info. They may attack the weakest player, or try to exploit elemental weaknesses. They may be even better at this on harder difficulties. Knowing about this can make it simple to predict which player a foe is going to attack next, and then protecting that player or moving them into backup.\"""
"\""Skill combos can greatly multiply damage, and are worth setting up more often than not. In two turns you can: Buff your main attacker, debuffs the foes\' defence, apply a status effect that improves elemental damage, freeze or stagger the foes, and then hit them with your strongest attack or two. All of these together multiply the damage exponentially! This is especially useful before using Limit Breaks and other powerful attacks.\"""
"\""Remember to take a break from playing video games every hour or so. Prolonged sitting can lead to hemorrhoids and early death (even in real life). You should also try to eat a vegetable occasionally, and remember not to look directly at the sun.\"""
"\""There are many advantages to switching your allies during battle: Switching does not cost a turn. Players in backup positions will automatically be healed. Players in backup may have better buffs, if active players have been debuffed or dispelled. Switching players frequently allows you to use skills with cooldowns more often.\"""
"\""Unlike previous Epic Battle Fantasy games, buffs don\'t stack in this game. A buff or debuff always applies a fixed value. For example, a 50% buff given to a player with an existing 20% buff will only result in a 50% buff. This makes debuffs very dangerous, as they can easily cancel out buffs. However, there also exists equipment that improves buff skills, which can lead to some enormous buffs.\"""
"\""Many status effects can be used in combination with others. For example: Being inflicted with both Wet and Chill may lead to Freeze. The Dry status increases the chances of being Burned or Scorched. Having Bad Luck and being hit with Doom leads to Death, but with Good Luck, Death only leads to Stagger. In addition, many status effects modify the damage caused by elemental attacks, and this can be exploited for defence or offence.\"""
"\""Some status effects can be crippling against certain foes. Many stronger foes resist the worst effects, but not always - check if a strong foe can be effected with Death or Syphon, for example. There may be a simple way to immobilize a powerful foe. There also exists equipment that can improve the chances of status effects working.
